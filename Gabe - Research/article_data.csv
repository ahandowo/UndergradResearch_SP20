The Washington Post’s Hank Stuever was particularly cutting: “The debut was like watching a network try to assemble its own Bride of Frankenstein, using parts of Ellen DeGeneres, Kelly Ripa and whatever else it can find.”

CNN’s Brian Lowry allowed that, “It's absurdly early, of course, to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of the Kelly experiment.” Still, he continued, “After tepid marks for her prime time newsmagazine and now her addition to ‘Today,’ it's worth considering that NBC News brass leapt at the opportunity to snag a high-profile news star without having fully thought through how best to deploy her.”

Jezebel also mocked the show, saying Kelly looked like “a HomeGoods catalog brought to life” and Newsweek was critical, as well.

LA Times TV critic Robert Lloyd was more generous, noting, “It is impossible to tell how anyone will do in this job from a first episode. (Guarded, even disappointed, reactions greeted the bows of Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah.)”

He added: “Hair needs to be let down, but Kelly’s first hour gave no indication that this is a job she can’t learn. It always takes time, and time alone will tell.”

NBC declined any comment on the initial reaction to the show.

Kelly began the hour by declaring herself “kind of done with politics for now.” The former Fox News anchor, who moderated multiple Republican presidential debates during the last presidential election, said she will seek instead to provoke “a smile, sometimes a tear, and maybe some hope to start your day.”

“We will be dissecting the latest tweet from President Trump,” Kelly said on the show, before making it clear that she was joking: “Oh no, we will not be doing that.”

In a recent interview with The Los Angeles Times, Kelly indicated that she knew getting the show right would take time.

“I have a nice long runway,” she said. “No one is expecting me to fly the plane perfectly and at 30,000 feet as soon as they turn the engine on. That takes some of the pressure off and allows me and my team to focus on content.”"

That is, in the woods, with wild things all around. No hurry. Happy to wait at the back of the line. But beyond the familiar “green burial” business of escaping the toxic culture of the conventional death industry, what I particularly like is the idea of using the cost of burials to buy and preserve undeveloped land — a relatively new wrinkle in the world of dead things. It just seems so much more appealing than the alternatives."
http://nyti.ms/2yq2UX6,An Open Letter From Dylan Farrow,['Dylan Farrow'],1391285072,"What’s your favorite Woody Allen movie? Before you answer, you should know: when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies. I remember staring at that toy train, focusing on it as it traveled in its circle around the attic. To this day, I find it difficult to look at toy trains.

For as long as I could remember, my father had been doing things to me that I didn’t like. I didn’t like how often he would take me away from my mom, siblings and friends to be alone with him. I didn’t like it when he would stick his thumb in my mouth. I didn’t like it when I had to get in bed with him under the sheets when he was in his underwear. I didn’t like it when he would place his head in my naked lap and breathe in and breathe out. I would hide under beds or lock myself in the bathroom to avoid these encounters, but he always found me. These things happened so often, so routinely, so skillfully hidden from a mother that would have protected me had she known, that I thought it was normal. I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different. I couldn’t keep the secret anymore.

 

 When I asked my mother if her dad did to her what Woody Allen did to me, I honestly did not know the answer. I also didn’t know the firestorm it would trigger. I didn’t know that my father would use his sexual relationship with my sister to cover up the abuse he inflicted on me. I didn’t know that he would accuse my mother of planting the abuse in my head and call her a liar for defending me. I didn’t know that I would be made to recount my story over and over again, to doctor after doctor, pushed to see if I’d admit I was lying as part of a legal battle I couldn’t possibly understand. At one point, my mother sat me down and told me that I wouldn’t be in trouble if I was lying – that I could take it all back. I couldn’t. It was all true. But sexual abuse claims against the powerful stall more easily. There were experts willing to attack my credibility. There were doctors willing to gaslight an abused child.

After a custody hearing denied my father visitation rights, my mother declined to pursue criminal charges, despite findings of probable cause by the State of Connecticut – due to, in the words of the prosecutor, the fragility of the “child victim.” Woody Allen was never convicted of any crime. That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up. I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls. I was terrified of being touched by men. I developed an eating disorder. I began cutting myself. That torment was made worse by Hollywood. All but a precious few (my heroes) turned a blind eye. Most found it easier to accept the ambiguity, to say, “who can say what happened,” to pretend that nothing was wrong. Actors praised him at awards shows. Networks put him on TV. Critics put him in magazines. Each time I saw my abuser’s face – on a poster, on a t-shirt, on television – I could only hide my panic until I found a place to be alone and fall apart.

Last week, Woody Allen was nominated for his latest Oscar. But this time, I refuse to fall apart. For so long, Woody Allen’s acceptance silenced me. It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away. But the survivors of sexual abuse who have reached out to me – to support me and to share their fears of coming forward, of being called a liar, of being told their memories aren’t their memories – have given me a reason to not be silent, if only so others know that they don’t have to be silent either.

Today, I consider myself lucky. I am happily married. I have the support of my amazing brothers and sisters. I have a mother who found within herself a well of fortitude that saved us from the chaos a predator brought into our home.

But others are still scared, vulnerable, and struggling for the courage to tell the truth. The message that Hollywood sends matters for them.

What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett? Louis CK? Alec Baldwin? What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?

Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.

So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter.

Are you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?"

We told our stories to one another, thinking they would be hysterically funny. We were full of zeal for this project. But the stories, when we told them, left us in tears and bewildered at how casually we had taken these horror stories and tried to make them into comedy. They were stories of assault. When they were spoken out loud, it was impossible to reframe them any other way. This is how we’d normalized the trauma, tried to integrate it, by making comedy out of it. We abandoned the film, but not the project of unearthing the weight of these stories, which we’d previously hidden from ourselves."

That come Monday as Taiwan-based EVA Air retired its last passenger version of the jumbo jet in Taipei.

Throngs of aviation enthusiasts gathered in Hong Kong to join the airplane for its final flight to EVA's Taipei headquarters. Pressed against the glass, they snapped photos and traded stories with one another while waiting to board.

“This is part of the reason I joined the aviation-industry,” said passenger Benjamin Hui of Hong Kong before boarding the jet. Hui worked as a loadmaster on the jet, and EVA 747s were some of the first airplanes he serviced.

On the flight deck, Capt. Dave Grose and first officer Ali Hsu were readying the airplane for its final departure but found it tough to get any work done, thanks to the never-ending queue of passengers hoping to pay them a visit. Fliers packed the airplane's cozy upper deck and clogged the stairwell in the moments before pushback and taxi. Visitors snapped photos, posed for selfies, and asked the two pilots to sign all manner of memorabilia.

That chaotic vibe continued once airborne. Within moments of the seat-belt sign turning off, passengers flooded the aisles, galleys and even the lavatories. It was all part of an effort to take in as much of EVA's 747 as they could. Flight attendants hurried about the jet as they worked to complete a meal service for all 370 passengers on the short, 1-hour, 17-minute flight.



After landing, enthusiasts rifled through seat-back pockets for unclaimed safety cards, taking them as unofficial momentos of the experience. A line once again formed for the two pilots, though this time down on the main deck.



For a jet that has served many airlines since the 1970s -- especially in Asia -- EVA's nearly 25-year run is comparatively short. But the addition of the plane to the EVA fleet in 1992 enabled the then-fledgling airline to spread its wings on trans-Pacific routes that had previously been beyond its reach.

EVA added Los Angeles first, in late 1992, before expanding to New York and Seattle the following year. EVA's 747 went on to serve 28 cities in its tenure with the company, airline officials said.

EVA also used the plane’s unique size to roll out one of the first premium economy cabins in the industry, making it one of the first with four classes of service (first, business, premium economy and economy).

When the airline cut first class from its jets, EVA installed economy seats on the airplane's considerably more-private-feeling upper deck, a perk almost exclusively limited to business class passengers on most airlines.



As for Monday's retirement, it comes roughly two years after the airline retired its fleet of 747-400 “combi” jets, a variant of the plane that could hold both passengers and freight on the main deck. The airline will continue to use its fleet of 747 cargo jets until 2019.

EVA's passenger 747 is exiting the airline's fleet at a time when many of the other carriers that have flown the ""Queen of Skies"" have already made similar moves. In the U.S., the last two 747 operates -- Delta and United -- each plan to retire the jet by the end of 2017.

EVA is planning to hold a big retirement ceremony for the passenger 747s on Thursday in Taipei. Afterward, the aircraft will join its already departed brethren at a scrapyard in the United States.



“It's emotional; now they're gone,” said passenger Hui. “Maybe I need to retire also!”

The director and producer worked together on several films in the 1990s, and Mr. Allen denied knowledge about any misconduct: “No one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” he said. “And they wouldn’t, because you are not interested in it.

https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/10/15/16438750/weinstein-sexual-harassment-facts,Study finds 75 percent of workplace harassment victims experienced retaliation when they spoke up,['Tara Golshan'],2017-10-15T09:00:02-04:00,"Shame, fear, and cultural norms all allow sexual harassment to go underreported.

There is so much we don’t know, but there is research that tells us some specifics about the state of the problem and the factors that make it better or worse in different workplaces.

Harvey Weinstein’s long alleged history of sexually preying on actresses, journalists, and musicians — and then scaring them into silence — has spurred a deeply charged national conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace. As more women speak up about this issue, demanding something be done, there is a lack of clarity of what can be.

The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a government agency responsible for processing the sexual harassment complaints that do get reported, says nearly one-third of the 90,000 complaints received in 2015 included a harassment allegation — but the agency notes that that number is far too low to reflect reality. They also estimate that 75 percent of all workplace harassment incidents go unreported altogether.

In 2016, the EEOC released a comprehensive study of workplace harassment in the United States, which concluded that “anywhere from 25% to 85% of women report having experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.” It’s a strikingly wide gap, but one that is very substantial even in its most conservative estimate — statistically predicting one in four people are affected by workplace sexual harassment.

In this void of concrete empirical data, we pieced together reports, surveys, and studies to outline the state of workplace sexual harassment in the United States — and what can be done to address it.

Sexual harassment is not an industry-specific problem, but some environments are worse, according to Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center:
• In male-dominated industries like construction, where women are seen as interlopers, women experience high levels of harassment.
• Service-based industries, in which employers rely on tips and customer approval, can also breed an environment of harassment. Reports have also indicated customer behavior can impact how supervisors treat their employees.
• Women in low-wage jobs, like hotel cleaners or farm workers, experience high levels of harassment because they do not have bargaining power to push back.

“Part of what sexual harassment is is an expression of power and expression of hostility,” Martin said. “When there aren’t women there to do the job, some men think women can’t do the job. When there are fewer women in the workplace, they are more isolated in general.”

Unionized workforces often see women being paid more equally and earning higher wages, which could help foster a more open culture around harassment reporting — unionized workforces in general aim to offer workers protections that could make victims less fearful of coming forward. But that doesn’t make them void of this kind of issue.

While workplace sexual harassment is often discussed in terms of women, men also experience sexual harassment in the workplace. According to a Washington Post survey, 10 percent of men have experienced sexual harassment at work. According to the EEOC, reports of men experiencing workplace sexual assault have nearly doubled between 1990 and 2009, from 8 percent to 16 percent of all claims.

This could be a sign of more incidents among men, but also is largely indicative of a changing culture around reporting, in which more people feel comfortable coming forward.

2) 75 percent of harassment victims experienced retaliation when they spoke up

As the Weinstein case exemplifies, women often don’t come forward with their experiences out of fear of retaliation. These fears are very valid and well-founded.

“One 2003 study found that 75% of employees who spoke out against workplace mistreatment faced some form of retaliation,” the EEOC report found.

In Weinstein’s case, the Hollywood executive would threaten up-and-coming actresses’ careers if they did not engage with him, or place negative stories about them in the media to mire their names in scandal. These tactics aim to isolate and silence victims.

When people do come forward, Vox’s Anna North explained, it’s usually when others around them do — strength in numbers. Once some of Weinstein’s accusers came out, more followed.

Formal reporting is the “least common response” among men and woman who have experienced harassment in the workplace — “approximately 30% of individuals who experienced harassment talked with a supervisor, manager, or union representative,” the EEOC study said. It continued:

A lot of this underreporting comes down to a fear of retaliation from the employers or colleagues. Victims often fear they won’t be believed, or will receive blame or be subject to professional retaliation — like being fired from their jobs.

3) When acts of “harassment” are specifically defined, more women report incidents

But there are also other factors that lead to underreporting.

Digging deeper into the numbers of people affected by workplace sexual harassment, the EEOC found that reports of incidents grew when the specific acts that count as harassment were more specifically defined in surveys.

In other words, when people were just asked outright if they had experienced sexual harassment at work, without the term being defined, one in four reported having experienced some form of harassment in the workplace.

But when specific acts of harassment were mentioned, like sexual coercion or crude jokes, 60 percent of women reported having experienced some form of sexual or gender harassment.

This indicates a lack of societal clarity around what constitutes harassment in the workplace — and what is brushed off as just uncomfortable encounters. The EEOC recommended sexual harassment trainings as an effective way to clarify those gray areas.

4) Those once-a-year sexual harassment seminars likely do nothing

Company sexual harassment training is easily mocked — and often brushed off in popular culture.

Even the EEOC admits its ineffectiveness:

“Much of the training done over the last 30 years has not worked as a prevention tool — it’s been too focused on simply avoiding legal liability,” its report says.

But there are innovations to anti-harassment programs that have seen some results, Martin says — namely in bystander training and tailoring programs to specific workplaces.

There is also an emphasis on middle managers, who are seen as the first line of defense against inappropriate behavior. One witness told the EEOC’s researchers:

None of this works, however, if there isn’t a clear message from the top that the company is invested in its employees and their well-being.

From the Weinstein events, as we saw with Fox News’s Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly, there is often institutional pressure to push allegations under the rug — the idea being that companies with a public face don’t want sexual harassment claims to go public because the alleged harasser is often a company star.

It’s why companies often process claims through mandatory confidential arbitration instead of an open court, and why so many cases allow for nondisclosure agreements.

These tactics can be effective in hiding the problem on two fronts: They keep victims feeling isolated, and at times like the only people affected, and they insulate the perpetrator. But the incentives might be backward.

“A superstar employee that is creating that toxic work environment is probably costing that company more than he or she is bringing in,” Martin says.

According to the EEOC, in 1994 the Merit Systems Protection Board, a federal agency that oversee the abuses targeting federal employees, conservatively estimated that “as a result of sexual harassment, job turnover ($24.7 million), sick leave ($14.9 million), and decreased individual ($93.7 million) and workgroup ($193.8) productivity had cost the government a total of $327.1 million.”

It all goes to say that there are a lot of systems in place that prevent people from speaking up.

“Even if you are rich famous and powerful, you can feel isolated in these situations,” Martin said. “But if you are not rich and famous and powerful, you still have to get your paycheck because it’s between you and homelessness. There are good reasons why it’s hard for women to bring formal complaints in these situations.”"

One year after Prince's death, I don't have any long-winded commentary about what made him special. Just an assemblage of thoughts, stories and video clips.

Here he is playing ""Gett Off"" at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. The first 50 seconds are full of good information should you ever find yourself pinned to a stage by multiple dancers: 1. Wail. 2. Wriggle away. 3. Bust into a split. 4. Pop out of the split. 5. Play sick guitar lick.

A friend on Facebook commented, ""I was just thinking that Prince may have been the only male singer that could pull buttless pants off with such style.""

That is true. Maybe Freddie Mercury?

Rolling Stone did a great Q&A with Morris Day that touched on his long working relationship with Prince. Though the best bit had nothing to do with Prince.

Q: Where did the ""Somebody get me a mirror!"" bit in your stage show come from?

A: Well, that was all just a part of being cool.

Obsessives may enjoy this book. Jim Walsh covered Prince rather extensively in the '90s and assembled all those pieces on an interesting era. '90s Prince wasn't prime Prince, certainly not compared to his '79-'89 run. But he was still banging out amazing music. When he slipped into autopilot, Walsh called him on it.

This week brought inevitable squabbling about the music. An EP called ""Deliverance"" was queued up for release. The only problem is his estate wasn't involved. Thanks to a court ruling, the EP is now a single. ""Deliverance"" is hardly a lost, great Prince album, but the six songs are well-recorded and find him plinking around outside his funky comfort zone. Hopefully they'll have a chance to circulate. On the legitimate side, here's a track list for the deluxe ""Purple Rain"" reissue due in June. Bootleg diggers may just find better quality versions of stuff they already have.

Speaking of ""Purple Rain,"" this clip is pretty great.

And then I'll close with a memory about walking with my wife to our car at 4 a.m. in March 2004 in New York. One tire had been slashed, a knife had been run along the side of the car and then another tire slashed. So changing to the spare wasn't an option. Temperatures were around 15 degrees, the heater in the car was busted. And Ivan, our tow-truck driver, had another job to complete before getting to us. So we sat in the car, uncomfortable but unbowed.

We'd just taken in one of Prince's after-party shows, which often had a looser, more spontaneous feel than his regular tour gigs. I remember it being joyous, maybe due in part to his induction earlier that night into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That induction ceremony included perhaps the best musical moment I've witnessed in person. This one.

Having grown up hearing the original Beatles/George Harrison song, I love the way Prince projected this guitar solo in an utterly Prince-like manner while also doubling back to the original with its Eric Clapton-played solos. The seams stretch nearly to the breaking point with information in the two-and-a-half-minute solo. It's like something out out ""Doctor Who,"" an unfathomable mix of reverence for history and maniacal self-regard.

Which kind of sums up Prince's genius. I miss the little guy."

I miss Michelle Obama.,[],,"Nearly a year ago in Philadelphia, the cradle of our republic, the City of Brotherly Love, first lady Michelle Obama gave the most stirring speech of the Democratic National Convention. If she had been the party’s presidential nominee, the outcome might have been very different. Instead, she was a mom telling the world how she instructed her daughters as she raised them from girls into adulthood in the White House.

Obama spoke of her family’s values: “How we urge them to ignore those who question their father’s citizenship or faith. How we insist that this hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. How we explain that when someone is cruel or acts like a bully you don’t stoop to their level. No, our motto is: when they go low, we go high.”

The nation cheered. It did not listen. Or not nearly enough people listened. Certainly not candidate Donald Trump. Sadly not President Donald Trump.

Michelle Obama delivered the winning oratory we Republicans have forgotten: Rick Wilson

Just over two weeks ago, June 14, a lone gunman shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise in a suburban Virginia ballpark. He and other Republicans were practicing prior to the annual Congressional Baseball Game. Scalise was seriously wounded, others were injured as well. The gunman is believed to have wanted to hurt Republicans and in the wake of that shooting, Republicans and Democrats alike called for a more civil discourse in Washington.

Even the president stated, “We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember everyone who serves in our nation’s capital because they all love our country.” The comity was short lived.

On Thursday morning, Trump’s Twitter feed was aglow in nastiness. His targets were Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, co-hosts of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” The president is not a fan of the show. Brzezinski is not a fan of the president. Such adversarial positions between elected officials and pundits or television personalities is hardly new.

But Trump cannot let any slight go untouched. In two successive tweets he wrote:

“I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don’t watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came..

“...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year’s Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!”

The president’s deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Fox News defended the president’s right to go on attack. “The president isn’t going to be someone who’s bullied and allows people around him and himself to be personally attacked.”

I don’t know who is 5 years old here — Trump or Sanders. Donald Trump is the 45th president of the United States. He cannot stoop to the level of the pig trough, regardless of whether he feels the media or anyone has said something he does not like. He is a public servant, and it is time he acted like one.

This stomping in the manure must end. It is unseemly. Undignified. And horrifying. Republicans defending Trump — and few were defending the specific personal attacks on Brzezinski on Thursday — often cite the low-level discourse from some Democrats. One does not justify the other. Civility has to start somewhere. And with the president, it should start with his Twitter feed.

As U.S. president, Trump is the most powerful person on the planet. With that power must come restraint. As a private citizen, Trump was disrespectful of public officials. He went to the front of the Birther Parade, continuing to claim Barack Obama was not a U.S.-born citizen. He denigrated women, immigrants and Gold Star parents. He mocked the physical size of U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. And his misogynistic comments about then Fox anchor Megyn Kelly after one of the presidential debates were disgusting.

And they are more revolting today when put in context with his Thursday tweet about Mika Brzezinski “bleeding badly from a face-lift.” Trump clearly enjoys demeaning women.

I won’t comment whether he is a good or poor president; there will be time enough to judge his administration’s achievements. But Trump is a pathetic example of being a man. Men don’t bully or berate women.

CNN needs to slow down after Russia story resignations and retraction

Brzezinski countered with her own tweet: an image of a box of Cheerios with a comment about the product being made for little hands, a reference to a slur against Trump during the 2016 campaign. Brzezinski may have thought her tweet funny and appropriate, but it only takes us further down the slippery slope into the muck.

Every insult cannot be countered with yet another insult.

""Strength to share our stories and feel supported by women and men who can say 'me too'.

https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-power-and-limitations-of-victim-impact-statements,The Power and Limitations of Victim-Impact Statements,"['Rebecca Makka i', 'Rebecca Makkai', 'Jeannie Suk Gerse n', 'Nathan Helle r']",2016-06-08T18:51:15.000,"Last week, the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s office released a victim-impact statement written by a twenty-three-year-old woman raped on the Stanford campus. The statement, which has gone viral, is sharp, clear, stunningly open, occasionally funny. Its author is a very good writer in the purest way: she makes us feel some sliver of what she felt.

I was startled to learn that she’d read this statement out loud in court to her assailant—that she hadn’t just been able to slip it under the judge’s door in the middle of the night and leave it at that. I wrote my own victim-impact statement at sixteen, and, on Monday, as I read about the Stanford case, I tried to remember what the procedure had been; I thought I had handed mine in like a term paper, or sent it through the mail. And then, on Monday night, it came back to me, twenty-two years after the fact: I did read my own statement out loud, in court, to my abuser. I’d had a choice, and I chose to do it. I might have been braver then than I am now.

That I didn’t remember this before has less to do with my blocking it out than with the fact that the memory is overshadowed by bigger plot points. Because, as soon as I delivered the statement, I was accused of plagiarism.

It was the summer of 1994, and I’d been listening to “Janie’s Got a Gun” on repeat since May. That summer, I read James Joyce for the first time; I also still had an American Girl doll in my closet. I was ten years past learning to ride a two-wheeler; I was ten years from publishing my first short story. From the age of seven to thirteen, I had been sexually molested by a family friend who occasionally lived in our house; in the summer of 1994, I was a few months from losing my virginity to someone I liked. I was closer to a healthy sense of sexuality, both chronologically and emotionally, than I was to the abuse.

At our local Children’s Advocacy Center, in suburban Illinois, a place filled with cheap stuffed animals, they asked me to point to the violated parts of a paper doll, as if I were a preverbal toddler. A lawyer named Sean (I was old enough, apparently, to call him that) asked me to write a victim-impact statement.

It strikes me now that there’s a remarkable volume of literature sealed in case files across the country. People writing the most honest things—in many cases, the only personal essays—they’ll ever write. I was an aspiring writer who took herself terribly seriously, and so I tackled that thing as a writing assignment. I used metaphor. I used vivid examples. There were scenes. I went through at least ten drafts. I was torn between the desire to show how well I was dealing with things and the imperative to show that I was not O.K., that this man’s actions had derailed my life in a thousand ways. Because how could both be true? I wound up editing any mention of recovery out of the letter. Weren’t my actions a show of strength already? When Sean saw the letter, he was so pleased that he asked if I’d give permission for it to be shown, anonymously, to other victims as a model. I was thrilled.

I read it on the witness stand, in the baggy dress I’d been advised to wear because I had a large chest and we didn’t want the judge to get the wrong impression of me. He was supposed to see me as the child I’d been, and a chest wouldn’t help. I was counselled not to wear makeup.

The defense lawyer was either inept or trying, actively, to throw the case. He disclosed in court, although he didn’t need to and the statute of limitations had passed, that the defendant had admitted to raping two women. The lawyer mispronounced words. He sweated through his shirt. And then, in his closing statement, he accused me of not writing my own victim-impact statement. He knew teen-agers, he said. He had a teen-age daughter, he had a teen-age nephew. And his teen-age acquaintances could not write that well.

The implications broadened from there. If I had fudged this statement, what else might I have fabricated? Even though the guy had already pleaded guilty, even though this was a statement of emotional impact, not my actual testimony, the victim was not to be trusted.

What unnerves me now about this resurfaced memory is that, for the past twenty years or so—from college on—public readings have been sacred to me. They are places where, regardless of the size of the crowd, I feel in control, where people are there to listen. Some of the best moments of my life have been readings in bookstores on the days my novels were released and I was surrounded by friends. To remember, suddenly, that I once performed a public reading of such a different kind makes me look forward to my next reading less.

How can you know six months or a year after a rape what the impact on your life will really be? A victim-impact statement is necessarily limited by when it was written. At sixteen, I had the benefit of three years of distance, some therapy, and a small sense of how the events of my childhood might affect the rest of my adolescence, at least. But a victim-impact statement is not a living document. I cannot call the courthouse to update it every time I notice something new—that, for instance, whenever I pass a certain car dealership I’ve driven by almost every day of my adult life I’m washed over with the exact queasy feeling I get when I pass roadkill. Or that, at the age of thirty-eight, I still avoid using the common noun that is homophonous with my abuser’s name.

The judge in my case wasn’t having any of the defense lawyer’s games. I’d like to say I was lucky, but can you call it luck when it’s what everyone deserves and few get? In his sentencing statement, the judge said—and these are words I remember precisely, because they went straight to my sixteen-year-old ego—“While her written statement bordered on the eloquent, so did her testimony.” It was perhaps the best literary review I’ll ever receive. He then handed down what was, at the time, a fairly harsh sentence in Illinois for aggravated third-degree child sexual abuse: ten months of work release.

I don’t imagine that victim-impact statements sway judges. I don’t imagine they reform criminals. I knew better, even at sixteen, than to expect my letter to sway anyone. If I wanted to prove something with my statement, it was that I was a good writer. That’s not as shallow as it sounds. I wanted, specifically, to prove to my abuser that I was now a grownup who could talk circles around him. That I owned this narrative in a way he never could. That I was smarter than him. That he’d picked the wrong kid.

I wrote a few terrible stories in college about sexual abuse but, until now, haven’t touched the subject again. Someone asked me once if I was scared to write about it. That’s not it at all. I don’t feel compelled to write about it anymore, because it’s already out of my system. I had the chance to speak, and—because in this case I had a judge who listened, because I felt heard—I moved on.

It’s a mercy that impact statements don’t need updating, even if some of us would love for rapists to receive weekly reports for the rest of their lives on the damage they’ve caused. If I could revise mine, twenty-two years on, it would say that I am over it, and that it is no part of who I am. It would also say the opposite."
http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/14/hillary-clinton-haunted-by-efforts-to-destroy-bill/,‘Enabler’ Hillary Clinton haunted by efforts to ‘destroy’ husband’s accusers,"['The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com', 'Kelly Riddell']",2016-01-14T19:54:11,"Running to be the first woman president, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has taken a stern stand on combating sexual harassment and assault — and has insisted that every accuser who comes forward has “the right to be believed.”

But Mrs. Clinton took a very different approach herself 25 years ago as the wife of then-Gov. Bill Clinton, leading the effort to discredit women who came forward with their own stories of harassment or assault by her husband.

Campaign narratives written by reporters detailed how she honchoed the campaign team that handled “bimbo eruptions,” digging up personal papers and official records that could be used to undercut the stories told by a series of women. One top aide later recounted Mrs. Clinton’s intent to “destroy” the story of one accuser, while former adviser Dick Morris said Mrs. Clinton engaged in “blackmail” to try to force women to recant their stories.

The disconnect between Mrs. Clinton’s historic campaign and her own past is quickly becoming an issue in the presidential election, driven in part by Republican opponent Donald Trump’s vow to make her husband, the former president, an issue for her.

And the women who lodged some of the worst complaints against Mr. Clinton are likewise intent on making sure Mrs. Clinton answers for her actions.

“Was dreading seeing my abuser on TV campaign trail for enabler wife but his physical appearance reflects ghosts of past are catching up,” Juanita Broaddrick, who in 1999 accused Mr. Clinton of having raped her decades earlier, tweeted last week.

A day later she wrote: “I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73 it never goes away.”

And Paula Jones, who sued Mr. Clinton for sexual harassment, winning an $850,000 out-of-court settlement to drop the case, said earlier this month that Mrs. Clinton enabled her husband in his abuse.

“Well, she stood by her man, all right. And she allowed her husband to abuse women, to harass women, possibly other things that he did wrong to women. And she allowed it to happen. As a matter of fact, she would go out and she would try to discredit these women, including me,” Ms. Jones told Breitbart Radio.

Now, with Mrs. Clinton in full campaign mode, analysts are debating whether Mrs. Clinton will suffer for her scorched-earth tactics toward the accusers.

“That’s what people do in political campaigns,” said lawyer and author Wendy Kaminer, who writes on feminism, religion and popular culture. “That Hillary is somehow complicit in whatever her husband did may resonate with people who oppose her anyway, but for people who support her, they will not be persuaded not to support her.”

Some feminists are rallying to Mrs. Clinton, dismissing the questions as politics.

“This whole conversation is irrelevant to Hillary’s ability to run the country,” said Martha Burk, former chair of the National Council of Women’s Organizations. “Trump’s just trying to be a sensationalist. This doesn’t have any place in the discourse about somebody’s ability to run the country; it’s a complete red herring. He’s trying to find something to take the attention away from the fact he doesn’t have the qualifications to be president.”

But the issue is clearly on some voters’ minds. Mrs. Clinton, at a town hall in New Hampshire last month, faced the first pointed question about her husband’s accusers.

“I would say that everyone should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence,” Mrs. Clinton said, quickly moving on to another question.

Neither Ms. Broaddrick, who accused the former president of rape, or Kathleen Willey, who accused Mr. Clinton of sexual assault, have had their stories disproved. And Ms. Jones’ husband said they considered the settlement the Clintons paid an “apology” to her.

This week, in an interview with CNN, Mrs. Clinton said she wouldn’t engage with Mr. Trump, who has said the former first lady must answer for her enabling of her husband.

“I have no response. I’m going to let him say whatever he wants to say. He can run his campaign however he wishes,” Mrs. Clinton said.

Mr. Clinton last faced voters 20 years ago, and an entire generation of voters has never had the chance to cast a ballot for him. Many of them did get a look at Mrs. Clinton during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, but her husband has become a bigger campaign issue this year, particularly with similar accusations being raised about comedian Bill Cosby.

Ms. Kaminer said younger women who weren’t old enough to vote in the 1990s probably have no memory of the scandals.

What they do have, however, is a modern take on definitions of what constitutes sexual harassment and the impermissibility of any breaches.

“Younger voters have a much more expansive view — and a punitive one — of sexual misconduct than we had 25 years ago,” Ms. Kaminer said. “Now some define ogling a woman as an act of sexual aggression — that’s one I don’t agree with, but still, the norms are out there. Whether or not that affects the way they vote remains to be seen.”

In the most recent New York Times/CBS poll released Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton trails rival Vermont Senator Bernard Sanders by a 2-to-1 ratio with primary voters under the age of 45 — though the poll doesn’t have a breakdown by sex for that age group.

Hoping to reach that demographic, Mrs. Clinton has paraded singer Katy Perry and feminist Lena Dunham out on the campaign trail this season.

In Iowa Ms. Dunham said backing Mrs. Clinton is a pro-feminist move.

“I can’t talk about Hillary Clinton without also acknowledging that she has survived horrific, gendered attacks on nearly every single aspect of her character with tremendous grace and aplomb,” Ms. Dunham, 29, said in Iowa last week. “The way she’s been treated by the media is just more evidence of the anger that exists toward women, particularly ambitious women, and the way we are not allowed to exist on our own merits rather than extensions of powerful men.”

And speaking to People magazine, Ms. Dunham said it was wrong to force the former first lady to answer for her husband’s actions.

“I think that women should not be forced to constantly answer for the rhetoric around their husbands’ lives,” Ms. Dunham said. “It’s really important to view Hillary as an independent candidate and as a person who has her own really interesting and beautiful track record of supporting and protecting women. While she’s clearly very connected to her husband, it’s fully her that I’m so excited to be talking about.”

Some voters do have concerns about Mr. Clinton himself, but the questions Mrs. Clinton is fending off suggest voters are also interested in her role in fighting the accusations — and tarnishing the accusers.

“This is all about Hillary Clinton’s treatment of women who may have been sexually abused,” MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said on his show this week. “Can she move forward in this campaign, talking about a war on women, as she did in Northern Iowa, that women who claim to be sexually abused have the right to be heard and the right to be believed? Do we have to examine what she did to protect herself and her position of power when women came forward and claimed sexual abuse on her husband’s part?”

Mrs. Clinton’s own former confidantes do not cast her behavior in a flattering light.

“There could be no question that Hillary was Bill’s fiercest defender in preventing his other women from causing trouble,” journalist Carl Bernstein wrote in his book “A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton.” “She never doubted that if the women, and the enemies who used them, succeeded or became too visible and credible, the whole edifice could come down, including their marriage.”

Mrs. Clinton would work side by side with Betsey Wright, then her husband’s top aide, to collect personal papers, correspondence and any official records on the women that could be used against them. The team also hired detectives to dig up whatever they could to snuff out what Mrs. Wright dubbed the “bimbo interruptions” before they could become a threat to his presidential aspirations, Mr. Bernstein reported.

While at the White House, Mrs. Clinton also took the lead in fending off damaging press inquiries.

In his book “All Too Human,” George Stephanopoulos, a chief adviser in the Clinton White House, recalls the story of Connie Hamzy, who told people she had shown her breasts to Mr. Clinton in a hotel in Little Rock.

“Clinton seemed to take great pleasure in picturing the scene again,” wrote Mr. Stephanopoulos, an anchor and political analyst for ABC News. “Hillary was less than amused. ‘We have to destroy her story,’ she said from her seat next to him on the plane. I was with her. Hamzy’s story didn’t sound funny to me either. It was flimsy, but it could do some damage if we didn’t snuff it out fast.”

Mr. Clinton’s most famous indiscretion was lying about having relations with then-22-year-old intern Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office. Although demonstrating “extremely bad judgment,” there were no accusations of rape, Ms. Burk said.

It also had nothing to do with Mrs. Clinton, she added.

But the aggressive tactics in silencing some of the women broke the Clintons’ ties to some of their closest aides and friends, including Mr. Stephanopoulous, who said he had to go after the Lewinsky affair came to light.

“I refused to vouch for Clinton’s credibility, and I couldn’t buy the party line that this was more about Clinton’s accusers than his own actions — which meant I was the enemy now. That’s the way it was with the Clintons — you were either for them or against them,” Mr. Stephanopoulous wrote.

Another casualty was Mr. Morris, their longtime pollster and friend.

“What really turned me off was what I call secret police,” Mr. Morris said in an interview with Larry King on Ora TV’s “PoliticKing” last year. “When she [Hillary] hired this fleet of detectives to go around examining all of the women who had been identified with Clinton. Not for the purpose of divorcing Clinton. Not for the purpose of getting him to stop, but for the purpose of developing blackmail material on these woman to cow them into silence that had a Nixonian quality to it that I hold against her, and I continue to.”"

“Let me say clearly and explicitly that I am very sorry,” she wrote. “What you wear and how you behave does not provide any protection from assault, nor does the way you dress or act in any way make you responsible for being assaulted; you are never responsible for being assaulted.”

This follows Bialik’s initial defense of the piece over the weekend. “A bunch of people have taken my words out of the context of the Hollywood machine and twisted them to imply that God forbid I would blame a woman for her assault based on her clothing or behavior,” she tweeted on Sunday. “Anyone who knows me and my feminism knows that’s absurd and not at all what this piece was about. It’s so sad how vicious people are being when I basically live to make things better for women.”

In the essay for the New York Times published Friday, Bialik wrote about her entering “the Hollywood machine in 1986 as a prominent-nosed, awkward, geeky, Jewish 11-year-old” while also knowing that “I didn’t look or act like other girls in my industry, and that I was immersing myself in a business that rewarded physical beauty and sex appeal above all else.”

But as she went on to describe the pressures that young girls like her faced to alter their appearance, and getting teased both by family and in the press, she added that she “always made conservative choices as a young actress.” Her parents warned her that men “only want one thing.” Her mother forbade makeup and manicures and “encouraged me to be myself in audition rooms, and I followed my mother’s strong example to not put up with anyone calling me ‘baby’ or demanding hugs on set. I was always aware that I was out of step with the expected norm for girls and women in Hollywood.”

“In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want. But our world isn’t perfect,” Bialik wrote. “Nothing — absolutely nothing — excuses men for assaulting or abusing women. But we can’t be naïve about the culture we live in.”

She wrote that she still makes choices she considers “self-protecting and wise” and that “my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.”

Bialik concluded the essay by writing that “if you’re not a perfect 10, know that there are people out there who will find you stunning, irresistible and worthy of attention, respect and love. The best part is you don’t have to go to a hotel room or a casting couch to find them.”

Patricia Arquette (whose sister, Rosanna, has publicly accused Weinstein of sexual harassment), wrote directly to Bialik on Twitter, “It is also not outrageous for anyone to [be] expected to be treated in a professional manner [sic] by anyone in a professional relationship.”

She continued in other tweets: “Is choosing to portray complicated characters an invitation for predators? Does that mean [you’re] fair game? Should we all just chose to tackle material that doesn’t explore that side of different women? Because Hollywood (and the world) has predators, is it a woman’s responsibility?”

Many celebrities remained mum in the days after, but then the company Weinstein co-founded fired him Oct. 8. Then, the New Yorker published its own bombshell story, with even more serious on-the-record accusations by women, including some who said Weinstein raped them."

2. Talk with somebody else about what's going on in their life. Hearing about what's happening to others may help you tune out a bit and offer a little perspective on your own issues.

3. Spend some time with a pet. Whether it's yours, or someone else's, petting an animal can really help improve your mood.

5. Take care of some plants. Water them, trim their leaves, repot them in fresh soil... it can feel empowering to nurture something, but it's also nice to connect with nature, even if it's in a small way.

6. Drink a glass of water. You might be dehydrated. When was the last time you drank a glass of water just for the sake of drinking it?

7. Listen to white noise. If you're feeling over-stimulated, white noise–like the sound of falling rain–can help you concentrate on something else, or ignore what you're trying to ignore for a little while."

The movement, which caused #MeToo to trend nationwide on Twitter Sunday night, apparently gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano sent a call to action to her more than 3 million Twitter followers.

People across the globe are standing up against sexual harassment and assault by posting the phrase “me too” on Facebook and Twitter in an effort to show how widespread the problem has become.

As of Sunday at 9 p.m., Milano’s post had more than 14,000 replies, 8,000 likes, and 4,400 retweets.

The post also prompted several other celebrities, including actresses Anna Paquin and Debra Messing, to come forward.

The posts come after The New York Times published an investigative report earlier this month detailing decades of sexual harassment allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein. (Among those who have come forward include actresses Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie.) Following the initial Times report, an article was published by The New Yorker in which 13 women accused Weinstein of sexually harassing or assaulting them since the 1990s.

Wire material from The New York Times was used in this report."
https://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/how-men-like-harvey-weinstein-implicate-their-victims-in-their-acts/amp,How Men Like Harvey Weinstein Implicate Their Victims in Their Acts,[],2017-10-11T21:45:49.883Z,"If you have ever experienced sexual assault or harassment, you know that one of the cruellest things about these acts is the way that they entangle, and attempt to contaminate, all of the best things about you. If you’re sweet and friendly, you’ll think that it’s your fault for accommodating the situation. If you’re tough, well, you might as well decide that it’s no big deal. If you’re a gentle person, then he knew you were weak. If you’re talented, he thought of you as an equal. If you’re ambitious, you wanted it. If you’re savvy, you knew it was coming. If you’re affectionate, you seemed like you were asking for it all along. If you make dirty jokes or have a good time at parties, then why get moralistic? If you’re smart, there’s got to be some way to rationalize this.

When you are a young woman, and you believe in your own worth and personhood and agency, it can be hard, despite the clichés that govern this situation, to understand that an older man who takes an interest in you does not necessarily share these beliefs. And, of course, young women are not the only victims of such crimes. But this is a basic and familiar pattern: a powerful man sees you, a woman who is young and who thinks she might be talented, a person who conveniently exists in a female body, and he understands that he can tie your potential to your female body, and threaten the latter, and you will never be quite as sure of the former again.

Afterward, you are rarely presented with even a single good option. Stay silent and you have acquiesced to whatever happened. Tell a friend and nothing much will be done. Come forward to an authority figure and you’ll face unfair consequences: people will be uncomfortable around you, perceiving ulterior motives; people will look for reasons that this happened to you, specifically; maybe you simply won’t be believed. There will be retribution—the power dynamic in these situations makes it a foregone conclusion. Men like Harvey Weinstein prey on women who are inexperienced enough that they can be penalized if they say no and implicated if they give in.

In Ronan Farrow’s account of Weinstein’s alleged decades-long pattern of cold, angry, vicious, sexually predatory behavior, this side of sexual victimization is particularly palpable in the actress Asia Argento’s story. Argento alleges that, in 1997, she was told she was attending a Miramax party but was brought to a hotel room that was empty except for Weinstein. He complimented her work, and then came out of the bathroom wearing just a robe, carrying lotion. When she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage, he pulled up her skirt and forcibly performed oral sex on her as she pleaded with him to stop. “It was a nightmare,” she told Farrow. Eventually, she says, she stopped protesting and feigned pleasure to make the encounter end faster. During the event and after, she says, she felt guilty for not physically fighting off his big naked body. Later on, she yielded to his pursuit and had consensual sex with him on multiple occasions.

In the story, it is clear that Weinstein, through this initial encounter, immediately and permanently altered Argento’s life and self-perception. She told Farrow that oral sex is “ruined” for her, and she described herself as “damaged.” “I am a fucking fool,” she said. The most crushing thing, reading the account, is that Argento seems to speak with such a minimum of rancor. In fact, most of the women who have spoken up about Weinstein—a group that includes, among many others, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie—have spoken with a tone that many women find familiar: a muted sadness, a long-kept knowledge of diminishment, a sense of undeserved yet inescapable remorse.

There are stories like theirs within every industry. But, on the rare occasions when such stories are publicly told, many crucial factors are often left out, or obscured: the complex dynamics that kick in during the incident; the deadening calculus that follows right after; the long, uneven, unpredictable aftermath. In Weinstein’s case, these factors are uniquely visible: he is a celebrity, many of his accusers are celebrities, and the business of Hollywood is partly conducted in public—the power matrix in the story is unusually clear. There are also, already, so many women accusing Weinstein, all speaking of such similar incidents, which occurred at such similar places within their respective careers, that the comet trail of each act contributes to a collective pattern. The case has illuminated the very ordinary reality of being a young woman with a desire to succeed, perform, and please others, who is sexually targeted by a powerful man in her field—a man who aims to use his position in a way that will affect her career and her selfhood whether she relents or escapes. These, too, are open secrets among women: what that moment feels like, what you think about when you consider your options, why you carry this stuff with you for so long.

There is no good exit from a hotel room with Harvey Weinstein. I am not prone to self-doubt, or even to taking things personally, but the slightest brushes I’ve had with men who bait-and-switched their interest in my work and my body have left me feeling that I am, as Argento felt she was, a fucking fool. The sense of diminishment, even if it’s slight or temporary, which it often is not, is exacerbated by the fact that men like Weinstein do not show themselves, spiritually or literally, to women above a certain point in the hierarchy of power, and they generally hide the worst of their behavior from other men. This makes for a false but often convincing narrative—you are prey only when you are not good enough, and so you must not have been good enough if you were prey.

This is, I think, the primary reason that some women maintain relationships with their attackers. When you are treated like an object, things about you that you cannot change are reframed. If a man interprets your youth as sexual vulnerability, he can make it seem that you have no choice but to be sexually vulnerable—after all, you have no choice but to be young. And so you might conclude that you need to redeem the encounter within a narrative that you may not like but in which you can at least actively participate. This might mean engaging in consensual sex afterward, to make you feel like you wanted it the first time, though you know you didn’t. Or staying friendly with the man in the hopes that you’ll find out that he actually did value you, and he wasn’t just hoping for access to your body. Or even trying to get something out of the transaction, whatever you can. This looks like weakness, but it’s an attempt to gain control. The Weinstein case has reminded me of how hard, maybe impossible, it is to separate yourself from all the things that have been forced on you—an encounter, a body, a sense of complicity, or simply the banal old scripts that make it all seem so sickeningly predictable. You were young and he was powerful; the story writes itself."

http://buff.ly/2okeNZS,"Hillary Clinton: ‘As a person, I’m OK. As an American, I’m pretty worried’",[],2017-04-06T04:00+00:00,"In her first wide-ranging interview since the November 8 election, Hillary Clinton spoke candidly on a range of topics. When prompted, she laid the blame for her loss to Donald Trump on a host of factors, pointing the finger at Russian president Vladimir Putin, FBI Director James Comey, WikiLeaks, and the entrenched culture of misogyny that dictates that the more successful a woman becomes, the less “likeable” she is.

Enjoying an animated interview with The New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof at the Women in the World summit on Thursday afternoon, the former secretary of state, energized and unfiltered, acknowledged that she and her team had made mistakes. Since the “devastation” of the defeat, she said, she’s been feeling OK as a person, “but as an American, I’m pretty worried.”

Clinton took direct aim at the Kremlin for attempting to influence the outcome of the presidential election. Russia’s intervention, she said, was given a boost by the explosive letter that Comey released ten days before the vote announcing another investigation into her emails.

“What was done to us was an act of aggression and it was carried out by a foreign power under the control of someone who has a deep desire to dominate Europe and to send us into a tailspin,” Clinton said of Russia’s “meddling” in the election, currently the subject of multiple investigations by intelligence agencies and the legislature. “And I think what Putin wanted to do was to sow distrust and confusion as well as influence our election.”

The Russian president employed the “weaponization of information,” Clinton said, a tactic he had “already used inside and outside Russia to great effect.” During the campaign, she confessed, she hadn’t fully understood “how impactful” the strategy was in creating doubt among voters.

“But then the Comey letter, coming as it did just 10 days before the election, raised serious questions in a lot of people—questions that I think were obviously unfounded, but nevertheless that happened,” Clinton said, attributing her defeat to “a combination” of causes. As she noted to applause, she nonetheless garnered 66 million popular votes.

“We’ve got to be really clear that what was done in that election was unprecedented and be willing to say we can’t let that happen again … We aren’t going to let someone sitting in the Kremlin with a thousand agents, with bots and trolls, try to mix it up in our election.” The communications stolen from her campaign [and published by WikiLeaks], she said, had a “determinative effect” that was “even more effective than Watergate.”

Putting her secretary of state hat back on, Clinton expressed indignation at Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons attack on civilians, including children. In a criticism of her former boss Barack Obama, she said she regretted that more had not been done during her tenure as America’s top diplomat to undermine Assad, a proved chemical weapons attacker, despite her own more hawkish outlook.

“We should have and still should” take out the Assad regime’s airfields, Clinton said. “People have to know that they will be held accountable as war criminals committing crimes against humanity if they engage in these aggressive, violent acts.”

Assad was “a prisoner of his family’s expectations, his dead father’s looming presence and his delusion … that everybody who opposed him is a terrorist,” Clinton said.

“That’s how Putin thinks. And Putin has weight, in particular with air power, to support this fight-to-the-death policy that Assad has.”

Regarding the Trump administration’s policy of trying not to offend Moscow, Clinton was blunt: “We’ve got to change the dynamic. It’s time the Russians were afraid of us because we are going to stand up for human rights, and the dignity and future of the Syrian people.”

Displaying her famous wit and sarcasm, Clinton delivered some one-liners rivaling those of the comedian Samantha Bee, who introduced her at the summit.

“The things that come out of some of these men’s mouths,” she said when asked about the Trump administration’s first 100 days, which included actions slashing funding to women’s health care, conducted in flagrantly all-male meetings and signing ceremonies. “Why do we have to cover maternity care? Well, maybe you were dropped by immaculate conception. Who knows?”

Her post-election time would be spent encouraging and helping women—younger women in particular—to get elected to public office and aid the Democrats in taking back the Congress, Clinton promised.

She appeared to rule out any future attempts to get back into electoral politics, preferring to work on her forthcoming book focusing on the reasons behind her poll loss and to spend time with her grandchildren, family, and friends.

Reports later surfaced that Trump called Comey a ""nut job"" during an Oval Office meeting with Russian officials and told them his firing relieved ""great pressure"" from the investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

Lawmakers are now awaiting Comey's first public comments since he was fired. Last week, Comey agreed to publicly testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

A report last week said Comey is expected to testify that he believes Trump was deliberately trying to meddle in the FBI's investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election."

http://nypost.com/2017/09/28/rory-mcilroy-food-has-been-my-downfall/?utm_campaign=iosapp&utm_source=twitter_app,Rory McIlroy: Food has been my downfall,[],2017-09-28T15:42:19+00:00,"Rory McIlroy has revealed his plan to turn a “great career into one of the greatest” — by quitting junk food.

The world No. 6, who has lost considerable weight since his days as an amateur, admitted he has a weakness for red wine, chocolate, burgers, chips and Stella Artois.

And his attempts to keep trim have been hampered by wife Erica being a brilliant baker and their obsession with the “Great British Bake Off.”

McIlroy teed off Thursday in the British Masters as he looks to claim his first trophy of 2017.

He will play in next week’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St. Andrews. But that will be the Northern Irishman’s final tournament of the year before he takes at least six weeks off, at which time he aims to sort out his eating habits.

“I would be the first one to say, my diet probably hasn’t been the best over the past year and a half,” McIlroy said. “When you travel a lot, sometimes it’s hard to get into a routine where you eat right, and you’re always eating out at restaurants and sometimes you don’t make the best choices.

“Like a dog, whatever you put in front of me, it’s going to be eaten. Whether I want it or not, if it’s there, I’ll have it. Baking’s [Erica’s] thing. The only thing we watch in our house at the moment is ‘The Great British Bake Off.’”

And asked what his other weaknesses are, McIlroy replied: “Red wine. Dark chocolate. Burgers, fries, Stella – everything!”

But McIlroy thinks his upcoming break will give him time to sort himself out — and be the springboard for future success.

“I’m looking forward to just getting myself right, getting myself healthy,” McIlroy said. “I’m taking a 10-day holiday after the Dunhill. Then once I get back, I’m doing quite a bit of testing. It’s just basically a full health MOT type of thing — get blood done, get some food allergy testing done.

“I want to use this time to delve deeper into trying to see where I can really make ins and where I can get better and be more disciplined. I think once you get into a routine and just make healthy eating a habit, it’s just much easier to make good choices. It’s not as if I’m an old man, but you look at all of the guys that are coming up behind me. And I want to do everything I can to leave no stone unturned and be able to just make sure that I feel as prepared as I possibly can be going into every event. These next three months could give me the foundation to have the next 10 years be even better than the 10 years I’ve just had. And that turns a great career into one of the greatest careers.”"

“Don can’t do any deals, because he’ll be overly scrutinized. He just goes to work every day and is miserable,"" a source in their circle added.

Trump Jr. has since appeared on Fox News, where he said he likely would have ""done things a little differently"" in retrospect.

President Trump has defended his eldest son, saying most politicians would have taken similar meetings.

A family friend especially close to Trump Jr. and Eric Trump told People the loyalty within their family is ""insane.""

“They would never speak against their dad,"" the family friend said.

http://wapo.st/2ueYzp5?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.73cedbe8bbf5,It’s not just young men — everyone’s playing a lot more video games,[],2017-07-11T17:02:18Z,"The amount of time Americans spend playing video games and board games has risen by 50 percent since 2003, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The typical American now spends more time playing games than volunteering, going to social events or going to church.

The numbers come from the American Time Use Survey, a nationally representative annual study that asks respondents to recount, in minute-by-minute detail, how they spent the previous day. On the average day in 2016, the average American age fifteen and older spent about 15 minutes playing games, up from 10 minutes in 2003, according to the survey.

If you exclude people who played no games at all, the typical gamer spent over two hours per day playing games in 2016.

That number is little changed since 2003, which means that the increase in average gaming time overall is due primarily to a surge in the number of gamers. In 2003, less than 8 percent of the population played games on a typical day. By 2016, that number had shot up to over 11 percent.

The American Time Use Survey doesn't distinguish between board games, such as Scrabble, and video games, such as Zelda or Overwatch. So it's impossible to know with certainty how much of the increase is driven by playing video games alone.

Video games were a $23.5 billion industry in 2015, according to the Entertainment Software Association, an industry trade group. Board and card games are a much smaller industry, ringing up about $1.2 billion in sales that year, according to industry analyst group ICv2. Those numbers suggest that video games account for the majority of time filed under “playing games” in the Time Use Survey.

There's been a great deal of focus on the rise of gaming time among young, unemployed men, thanks to a recent working paper by researchers at Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of Rochester. But the Time Use Survey data show that the increase in gaming hasn't been limited to just young men. Indeed, there's been a larger increase in gaming time among women (58 percent) than there has among men (50 percent) since 2003.

Today, similar percentages of men (12.3) and women (10.3) play games on a typical day.

Since there are only 24 hours in a day, any increase in gaming time has to be offset by a decrease in time spent on other things. While the survey numbers can't pinpoint this with certainty, they do show that since 2003 there have been substantial drops in a number of other leisure activities that game playing might take the place of, including socializing (seven-minute daily decrease since 2003), reading (four-minute decrease), and arts and entertainment, not including TV (two-minute decrease).

The Time Use Survey also has data on where people play games the most. Colorado leads the nation on the percentage of residents (13.4) who play games on a typical day, followed by Minnesota (13.2), Kansas (11.6), New Hampshire (11.6) and Rhode Island (11.2).

On the flip side, in Hawaii only 3.1 percent of residents play games on a typical day, making it the least gaming-addicted state in the nation (this makes some sense — when you live in an island paradise, who needs to sit in front of a screen?). Hawaii is followed by New Mexico (4.9), Georgia (5.7), Mississippi (6.0) and South Carolina (6.1)."

You will think that you have stated the case simply and effectively, and everyone else will wonder why you were so Terrifyingly Angry. Instead, you have to translate. You start with your thought, then you figure out how to say it as though you were offering a groveling apology for an unspecified error. (In fact, as Sloane Crosley pointed out in an essay earlier this year, the time you are most likely to say “I’m sorry” is the time when you feel that you, personally, have just been grievously wronged. Not vice versa.)

To illustrate this difficulty, I have taken the liberty of translating some famous sentences into the phrases a woman would have to use to say them during a meeting not to be perceived as angry, threatening or (gasp!) bitchy.

“Give me liberty, or give me death.”

Woman in a Meeting: “Dave, if I could, I could just — I just really feel like if we had liberty it would be terrific, and the alternative would just be awful, you know? That’s just how it strikes me. I don’t know.”

“I have a dream today!”

Woman in a Meeting: “I’m sorry, I just had this idea — it’s probably crazy, but — look, just as long as we’re throwing things out here — I had sort of an idea or vision about maybe the future?”

“Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”

Woman in a Meeting: “I’m sorry, Mikhail, if I could? Didn’t mean to cut you off there. Can we agree that this wall maybe isn’t quite doing what it should be doing? Just looking at everything everyone’s been saying, it seems like we could consider removing it. Possibly. I don’t know, what does the room feel?”

“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”

Woman in a Meeting: “I have to say — I’m sorry — I have to say this. I don’t think we should be as scared of non-fear things as maybe we are? If that makes sense? Sorry, I feel like I’m rambling.”

“Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.”

Woman in a Meeting: “I’m not an expert, Dave, but I feel like maybe you could accomplish more by maybe shifting your focus from asking things from the government and instead looking at things that we can all do ourselves? Just a thought. Just a thought. Take it for what it’s worth.”

“Let my people go.”

Woman in a Meeting: “Pharaoh, listen, I totally hear where you’re coming from on this. I totally do. And I don’t want to butt in if you’ve come to a decision here, but, just, I have to say, would you consider that an argument for maybe releasing these people could conceivably have merit? Or is that already off the table?”

“I came. I saw. I conquered.”

Woman in a Meeting: “I don’t want to toot my own horn here at all but I definitely have been to those places and was just honored to be a part of it as our team did such a wonderful job of conquering them.”

“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

Woman in a Meeting: “I’m sorry, it really feels to me like we’re all equal, you know? I just feel really strongly on this.”"

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4861436,"When No Means No, But Universities Don't Listen",[],2014-02-26 17:25:09 -0500,"In August of 1994, my mother dropped me off at Daum residence hall, where I would live for the next year as a freshman at the University of Iowa. Three weeks later, a student I had recently met attempted to rape me in a friend's dorm room on another part of campus. I said no. I said stop. I said please, no. I said all the words that meant I did not want it to happen. Not there with him on the floor -- and definitely not with two of my friends in the room hooking up with other guys. I said the words. I may have not said the words when he started kissing me, but I definitely said them when he pulled down my pants, when his arms twisted through mine and his feet spread my legs open, when I tried to push him off of me, when he ripped down my underwear and when -- finally -- I found the strength to kick him and run out of the room. I sat with my back against lime-green tiles in a bathroom down the hall. This was before cell phones. I had no immediate connection to the outside world, so I sat there, crying, until I was brave enough to walk back into the room where I was almost raped. When I returned, the guy was still there, but was passed out. My friends were still there, also passed out. It was a typical scene after a night of partying -- except for me sitting on the couch until sunlight came through the window. The next morning it was as if nothing happened. I wrote about it my journal. And then I forgot. But not really. Almost 20 years later, as a wife and mother, and as a writer and teacher, I read an article in which University of Iowa President Sally Mason says the ""goal is to never have another sexual assault. That's probably not a realistic goal just given human nature, and that's unfortunate, but the more we understand about it, the better we are at trying to handle it and help people get through these difficult situations...""

When I read Mason's words, I felt ashamed.

 

 Ashamed that nothing has changed. Ashamed that the female president of my alma mater -- a school I love despite what happened to me -- could say such words even if she retracted them later. Ashamed that even after eight sexual assaults have been reported to university officials this academic year, it appears not much has been done.

 

 I also know that even more cases are going unreported. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, sexual assault is one of the most under-reported crimes, with 60 percent still being left unreported.

 

 More than I am ashamed, however, I am proud -- proud of students at the university who are speaking out against Mason. Because I couldn't, because others cannot.

 

 If I could go back and tell my 18-year-old self anything, I would tell her this: Respect yourself enough to stand up for yourself.

 

 But it's more complicated than that. Isn't it? Where should I have gone? To whom should I have turned?

 

 The residence assistant on the floor? It wasn't my dorm. Had I been drinking? Yes. Was I underage? Yes. Does it matter? Yes. It matters because this made me afraid to tell, afraid to get help, afraid to move.

 

 Does it justify what he did? No.

 

 At the time, I believed, in some ways, it was my fault. I had no idea where to report such an incident. In fact, I'm not sure reporting it ever crossed my mind. I was ashamed of myself for putting myself in that situation.

 

 But shouldn't a young woman feel safe with two of her friends in the room? Shouldn't no mean no? Shouldn't a university be able to do something to prevent such an act -- or at the very least help a victim feel comfortable enough to come forward?

 

 I agree with the protesters who are retorting, ""Rape is not human nature."" The man who sexually assaulted me was not programmed to force himself on me. He had a choice.

 

 If University of Iowa officials -- and those at other universities -- turn their backs on victims and allow students who assault other students to remain on campus, they are reinforcing Mason's statement that these acts are just ""human nature."" They cannot be controlled -- and that we, the victims, need to remain silent because nothing can be done.

 

 This is unacceptable.

 

 Universities need to do more. They need to create programs that educate young men and women about sexual assault. They need to seriously examine the drinking cultures at their schools. Most important, they need to support the victims by providing a safe space for people to report these crimes.

 

 Do not let another 20 years go by. Let's put an end to sexual assaults on college campuses everywhere."

Conway thanked the crowd and encouraged them to continue to stand firm and push forward freedom and democracy.

She said she didn’t “know how she would be able to do any of this without my faith.” She said humility is an essential component of serving in the position that she does now.

Conway said that she approaches her job as a woman of faith, with an attitude that she is blessed and privileged to serve her country at the moment, knowing “for every time there is a season and that God places us in certain areas, at certain points in our life.”

“The greatest professional privilege of my life is to work for the President, the Vice President, and this great nation,” said Conway, adding, “The greatest privilege of my life by far is being mother to those four children.” She said nothing compares to it and gives her perspective constantly.

“I’m not in the White House to read about myself. I’m there to serve and there to work on significant issues and challenges of the day,” Conway said of turning off her social media notifications earlier this year.

“I work in a White House where working moms, and certainly women, are respected and elevated to the highest positions,” Conway went on to say. She recounted Trump’s years in New York real estate when he “took a chance on women … when no one else would.”

“The thing about Donald Trump that I’ve never heard him say and he’s certainly never said to me, is ‘I think this will help with the women,’” said Conway, pointing out the “identity politics that the other side is so wrapped up in.”

She said she wouldn’t work where she does or for whom she does if she didn’t know who they are and how family-centric they are.

Conway continued, juxtaposing her experience serving in the White House to the scandal in Hollywood and Harvey Weinstein.

“I appreciate that because I hear a lot of people up on their soap boxes, the high horse cavalry always talking about women’s rights and women in the workplace and women empowerment. I’m in an environment where it’s practiced regularly,” she said.

“I think there’s a great juxtaposition going on right now. You see one of the major influencers in Hollywood and major Democratic donor really ensnared in some pretty ugly stuff, allegedly, and the juxtaposition of that is I, at least, am in a place where women are respected, and I appreciate that as a working mom.”

Conway also talked about how her “faith informs” her beliefs and how she learns about people. “To attract people politically, you must first understand them culturally. Show me how somebody spends his or her weekend and I’ll tell you how they’re gonna vote,” she said.

She talked about her decades of working on pro-life messaging and President Donald Trump sending her and the Vice President to participate in the March for Life this year. Conway remarked, “It took a Manhattan billionaire, male, who for part of his adult life was pro-choice for abortion rights, to give the most impassioned defense of life I had ever heard from a presidential debate podium on October 19th last year.”

Conway added that evangelical Christians are not monolithic, not single-issue voters. She noted that the crowd cheered President Trump that same morning as he talked about healthcare, tax reform, the Iran Deal, and combatting terrorism."

The Confederates are coming! The Confederates are coming!

Union scouts have already discovered Robert E. Lee at the gates of the city, lining up the gallant Pelham’s artillery to fire the opening round, and Stonewall Jackson and Jeb Stuart are expected to arrive on a night train from the Shenandoah Valley.

Not since First Manassas, when the Yankees fled the battlefield in blind panic, after taking a licking in the first battle of the Cruel War of Northern Aggression, has the Capital quailed in such fear and trembling.

This time it’s only an army of marble, but marble men are apparently enough against a foe of the weak and the weary of combat. Cities, counties and states across the nation have been taking down Southern statuary for days — brave Baltimore waited for the cover of night to do the deed — all in hopes of being spared the wrath of the regiments of bronze and marble regiments. Californians scoured graveyards for evidence of insurrection and finally found something in Hollywood, of all places.

These were the graves of dead Confederates exiled from formerly Confederate states from Virginia to Texas who repaired to the balm of mild and gentle California to live out their final days, only to die forgotten in an alien land. The searchers found a plaque, overgrown with moss and soil, identifying those who sleep there. The plaque, though not a trophy as valuable as statuary of Lee or Jackson, was nevertheless removed as a prize of combat with the dead. The Los Angeles Times reports that “the bodies will not be disinterred.” Well, not now, anyway. Maybe next week, when the remains can be properly flogged and assigned to the city dump.

Back among the living, you might think the Democrats would be in Hog Heaven, intoxicated with the prospect of slaying Donald Trump at last. Metaphorically speaking, of course. (We think.) But months of malaise — the French call it “ennui,” or lassitude for lack of excitement — have made havoc of Democratic fundraising.

Even with the prospect of a riveting candidate for 2020, someone like Elizabeth Warren, Maxine Waters, Bernie Sanders or even Hillary retrieved from the mothballs for a third try, Democratic fundraisers report that Democratic donors are exhausted. Throwing good money after bad, even in pursuit of Donald Trump, is not ringing bells and blowing whistles where big money dwells. The targets for next year’s congressional races look more inviting, but apparently only in Washington and other haunts of campaign consultants.

The raw numbers are enough to alarm Pollyanna and her friends. The Democratic National Committee raised $38 million in the first half of this year, and while that sounds like a lot, the Republicans raised almost twice that, with $75 million. At the end of June, the debt-free Republicans had $45 million in the bank; the Democrats have only $7 million in the bank and $3 million in debt. “We really should be kicking them in the [hindquarters],” a glum Democratic donor tells the Capitol Hill political daily The Hill.

If the Republicans are embarrassed by the stumbling Republicans in Congress and Donald Trump’s continuing struggle with foot-in-mouth disease, the Democrats can only mimic the misery of Casey Stengel as he managed the New York Mets through their inaugural year when they couldn’t win for losing, often by boxcar numbers: “Can’t anybody play this game?”

By the numbers on the money, apparently not, though the fundraising numbers don’t tell the whole story. Mitch McConnell can’t seem to find a way to keep his senators marching in cadence to the music, enabling John McCain, who dreams of becoming the pet Republican of the mainstream media again, and a couple of others from co-operating with the Democrats in recycling Harry Truman’s famous campaign label, “the do-nothing Congress,” and affixing it firmly to the party that once nominated Mr. McCain for president.

President Trump has become a Republican pinata, inviting everyone to take a whack. But he continues to draw crowds and money, both big money and small money. His approval ratings hover just below 40 percent, but it’s the most faithful 40 percent anywhere.

He collected $10 million for his re-election at a fund-raiser at his hotel in Washington this summer, and the Republican National Committee continues to outraise the Democrats among small-dollar donors — under $200 — and by a big margin.

The Democrats, with big help from not only the media but establishment Republicans who just can’t get over November, are counting now on backlash over Charlottesville to do what Robert Mueller was only yesterday counted on to do.

But killing dead Confederates won’t do it, either. Democrats tempted to fight a Lost Cause of their own should find romance somewhere else. Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas on a bronze horse won’t thrill anyone.

Before you answer, you should know: when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies. I remember staring at that toy train, focusing on it as it traveled in its circle around the attic. To this day, I find it difficult to look at toy trains.

For as long as I could remember, my father had been doing things to me that I didn’t like. I didn’t like how often he would take me away from my mom, siblings and friends to be alone with him. I didn’t like it when he would stick his thumb in my mouth. I didn’t like it when I had to get in bed with him under the sheets when he was in his underwear. I didn’t like it when he would place his head in my naked lap and breathe in and breathe out. I would hide under beds or lock myself in the bathroom to avoid these encounters, but he always found me. These things happened so often, so routinely, so skillfully hidden from a mother that would have protected me had she known, that I thought it was normal. I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different. I couldn’t keep the secret anymore.

 

 When I asked my mother if her dad did to her what Woody Allen did to me, I honestly did not know the answer. I also didn’t know the firestorm it would trigger. I didn’t know that my father would use his sexual relationship with my sister to cover up the abuse he inflicted on me. I didn’t know that he would accuse my mother of planting the abuse in my head and call her a liar for defending me. I didn’t know that I would be made to recount my story over and over again, to doctor after doctor, pushed to see if I’d admit I was lying as part of a legal battle I couldn’t possibly understand. At one point, my mother sat me down and told me that I wouldn’t be in trouble if I was lying – that I could take it all back. I couldn’t. It was all true. But sexual abuse claims against the powerful stall more easily. There were experts willing to attack my credibility. There were doctors willing to gaslight an abused child.

After a custody hearing denied my father visitation rights, my mother declined to pursue criminal charges, despite findings of probable cause by the State of Connecticut – due to, in the words of the prosecutor, the fragility of the “child victim.” Woody Allen was never convicted of any crime. That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up. I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls. I was terrified of being touched by men. I developed an eating disorder. I began cutting myself. That torment was made worse by Hollywood. All but a precious few (my heroes) turned a blind eye. Most found it easier to accept the ambiguity, to say, “who can say what happened,” to pretend that nothing was wrong. Actors praised him at awards shows. Networks put him on TV. Critics put him in magazines. Each time I saw my abuser’s face – on a poster, on a t-shirt, on television – I could only hide my panic until I found a place to be alone and fall apart.

Last week, Woody Allen was nominated for his latest Oscar. But this time, I refuse to fall apart. For so long, Woody Allen’s acceptance silenced me. It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away. But the survivors of sexual abuse who have reached out to me – to support me and to share their fears of coming forward, of being called a liar, of being told their memories aren’t their memories – have given me a reason to not be silent, if only so others know that they don’t have to be silent either.

Today, I consider myself lucky. I am happily married. I have the support of my amazing brothers and sisters. I have a mother who found within herself a well of fortitude that saved us from the chaos a predator brought into our home.

But others are still scared, vulnerable, and struggling for the courage to tell the truth. The message that Hollywood sends matters for them.

What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett? Louis CK? Alec Baldwin? What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?

Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.

So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter.

Are you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?"

The man refers to me constantly as his wife — to waiters, customer service representatives, friends, and family — because the word “girlfriend” sounds ridiculously insufficient to him. Plus, he’s definitely proposed on a few occasions (when he was a tad buzzed, maybe, but also because he was maybe serious), and I’ve always politely declined.

It’s not that I’m not madly in love with my boyfriend (I am), or that I don’t plan on spending the rest of my life with him (I do). The simple truth is, I give exactly zero fucks about the institution of marriage.

If only I’d responded to that prying guy with some smart, dignified comment that at once put him in his place and established that I don’t aspire to be married — ever.* Instead, I faltered over my next few sentences, mangling some version of the response I always give in such situations:

“He keeps proposing, and I just keep saying no…Plus, if we get married, I know someone will force me to have a wedding, and I hate being the center of attention…I’d rather keep the cash than throw a giant party I’d probably want to Houdini from around midnight anyway.”

While these statements are an accurate reflection of my feelings on the subject, my claims are never interpreted as honest, probably because I deliver them so damn sheepishly rather than in the empowered way I’d like to. I tend to come off as if I’m justifying my relationship status rather than celebrating it. Why? Maybe because I’m used to fielding the doubt that follows a no-thanks-to-marriage assertion from a 30-something woman who’s been dating the same guy for a long-ass time.

I understand that society is designed to favor married couples, especially those who choose to raise children. I also know that some women genuinely dream of a fairytale wedding, and while certain aspects of the modern wedding make me squirm with discomfort, I don’t blame anyone for aching to toast their coupledom amongst friends and family. I also fully respect and appreciate that some couples marry primarily for financial and/or religious reasons.

All of that said, as half of a happily married duo, I take issue with the sense of validation people attach to the institution of marriage — as if married couples are necessarily more serious, more committed, or more in love than their unwedded counterparts. Tying the knot doesn’t guarantee lasting happiness, and it certainly doesn’t protect you from breaking up. What it does is make the process of splitting a whole lot trickier from a logistical standpoint.

It seems like a lot of people marry to feel safer in their relationship — to procure some degree of certainty that their significant other is less likely to flee when shit gets tough. I’m not suggesting there’s anything wrong with that. But aren’t long-term couples that forgo the nuptial seal worthy of the same respect?

I don’t need a license to know in my heart that my boyfriend adores me, or that he’s committed to sticking it out. Nine years after locking eyes for the first time, we still crave nothing more than to be in each other’s company. We are best friends, playmates, and lovers. We’ve merged our financial resources and divided all household chores equally. We are each other’s most trusted advisors, go-to confidantes, and medical proxies. We know each other’s social security numbers and passwords to (almost) every single account. His parents even refer to me as their daughter-in-law without the necessary paperwork.

Of course, like any other couple, my boyfriend and I fight occasionally, and we sometimes experience relationship doubts. But we’re in it for the long haul. I don’t need some higher power to witness him promise forever, or a government official to ratify our commitment. His word is sufficient.

Maybe I’m a curmudgeon intent on bucking convention because she’s incapable of appreciating tradition. Maybe I’m secretly jealous. Or maybe I’m just lucky to be with someone I trust that much — someone whose signature I do not need as proof of his plans to stay with me until death says our time is up."

Many individuals disagreed with my action at that time.”

“So this was the first step and now what we of soon after Charlottesville and around the country that those statues have very similar significance to what went on when I took the Confederate flag off our license plates,” he continued. “They are — monuments should be unifiers.

Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.

Organizers of the midday event, billed as a “Free Speech Rally,” have publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and scores of others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.

Opponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville. But only a few dozen conservatives turned out for the rally on historic Boston Common — in stark contrast to the estimated 15,000 counterprotesters — and the conservatives abruptly left early.

One of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event “fell apart.”

Congressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn’t realize “how unplanned of an event it was going to be.”

Some counterprotesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: “Make Nazis Afraid Again,” ”Love your neighbor,” ”Resist fascism” and “Hate never made U.S. great.” Others carried a large banner that read: “SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.”

“I came out today to show support for the black community and for all minority communities,” said Rockeem Robinson, 21, a youth counselor from Cambridge.

He said he wasn’t concerned about his personal safety because he felt more support on his side.

Katie Griffiths, 48, a social worker also from Cambridge, who works with members of poor and minority communities, said she finds the hate and violence happening “very scary.”

“I see poor people and people of color being scapegoated,” she said. “Unlearned lessons can be repeated.”

TV cameras showed a group of boisterous counterprotesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counterprotesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counterprotesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman’s hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.

Yet Saturday’s showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.

The Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.

“We are strictly about free speech,” the group said on its Facebook page. “We denounce the politics of supremacy and violence.”

Dating to 1634, Boston Common is the nation’s oldest city park. The leafy downtown park is popular with locals and tourists and has been the scene of numerous rallies and protests for centuries.

Rallies also were planned in cities across the country, including Dallas, Atlanta and New Orleans.

Hundreds of people gathered at City Hall in Austin, Texas, Saturday morning, holding signs in support of racial equality. The Austin American-Statesmen reported organizers for the Rally Against White Supremacy estimated about 1,200 people were in attendance.

Trump Jr. is facing backlash after news surfaced earlier this month that he took a meeting last year with a Russian lawyer.

Last week, Trump Jr. released a chain of emails detailing his conversations about setting up a meeting with a Russian lawyer, who he was told had compromising information on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonFox's Stirewalt: 'You could not fathom a worse running mate' for Biden than Hillary Clinton Biden widens lead over Trump in Monmouth poll, but Amash may present problem Handicapping the Biden VP race: Kamala Harris by a mile MORE.

Kendzior failed to back up her claim that “actual Nazis” are still in the White House, only saying that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a “long-time antagonist against civil rights.”

“[T]his is still a white-supremacist house,” Kendzior argued. “You still have actual Nazis in the house. You have Jeff Sessions, who’s a long-time antagonist against civil rights and you have policies that back up these ideas in practice. And so what Bannon is probably going to do when he leaves is just support this aspect of Trump’s agenda from the outside, which could be, actually I think, more dangerous and more harmful than having him in the White House, where he was, as mentioned, somewhat contained.”"

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59e4badfe4b04d1d51834114,Me Too: The Difficult Truths About Gay Men And Sexual Assault,[],2017-10-16 15:33:24 -0400,"I have never told anyone this ― not my best friend, not my boyfriend, not my mother, not my brothers: nine months ago I invited a stranger over to have sex and it went further than I wanted it to and it did not stop when I tried to stop it.

He was an acrobat on tour in New York City who I met on Grindr and as cliche as it sounds, I was excited by the thought of him twisting and untwisting in my bed. I wanted to see exactly what he could do ― and do to me ― with his beautiful German body.

I didn’t intend on him penetrating me. Everything about penetrative sex ― from the prep involved to the level of intimacy it often holds for me to the concerns about health and safety ― tends to keep my sexual encounters with strangers (or semi-strangers) to hand jobs and blow jobs. But this particular man was incredibly persuasive and before I knew it, he was inside of me.

To say that I did not enjoy the experience would be an understatement. At first I tried to tell myself that it was OK ― that I was OK ― but as he continued to become more and more forceful, I suddenly realized that I was not. I panicked. I asked him to stop and he tried to convince me that because he was having a good time, I was having a good time. I was not having a good time. I asked him again, more insistently, to stop and, again, he kept going. He told me to relax. He suggested I position my legs in a certain way to make it “more comfortable” for myself. He did not stop. I realize now, looking back, the question running through my head wasn’t just “how can this really be happening?” but also “is this really happening?”

Even now, in the midst of all of the conversations that are happening about sexual assault and harassment in the wake of the dozens of accusations against Harvey Weinstein (and other powerful men), I not only question exactly what happened (even though I know what happened). I also question if there was something ― if there were many things ― I had done wrong. If, because I invited him over only and explicitly for sex; if, because I did initially agree to let him penetrate me; if, because I didn’t fight harder, was I to blame for what happened that late January night?

No. I wasn’t. And so, yes, me too. And so many other men ― gay, bisexual, straight and otherwise ― have been assaulted and many of us, due to pride or embarrassment or just being unable to untangle the tricky, slippery strands of how and why ― say nothing or find ways to explain away or, worse, blame ourselves for what happened. What’s more, because it’s so taboo for men ― gay or otherwise ― to talk about being sexually assaulted, few of the conversations that need to be happening are happening.

And still, as much as I want as many people as possible talking about sexual assault and sexual harassment, I was disheartened to read an op-ed in USA Today this morning by Marc Ambinder entitled “How does Harvey Weinstein happen? Visit a gay bar with me.” In his piece, Ambinder attempts to tie non-consensual touching and kissing in gay bars to Weinstein and the culture that allows him and other men to force their way ― in so many ways ― onto women.

While, yes, non-consensual interactions in gay bars do happen (and more often than many gay men want to think or talk about), and, yes, as Ambinder suggests, gay men may have “more responsibility to police ourselves,” I don’t think it’s useful (and I’d go so far as to say it’s downright problematic) to make this kind of a connection in this kind of a way.

In fact, I think it’s important to say that what happened to me is not the same as what happened to the women who were attacked by Weinstein. And I think it’s important to say what happened to the women attacked by Weinstein is not the same as what happens to gay men who are groped without consent by other gay men in gay bars or anywhere else. The point is that one assault cannot be ― and shouldn’t be ― super imposed over another in hopes of finding meaning or solace or answers for how we move forward. They each occur in their own terrible, traumatic way. To lump them all together not only potentially diminishes ― and thereby potentially dishonors ― each specific story, but, I believe, stops us from having nuanced conversations about how we can work together to end this toxic part of our culture and all of the ways it seeps into our lives.

What’s more ― we need to believe men when they say they’ve been assaulted ― and when they say “no,” no matter where or when or why they’re saying it. But we also need to talk about how sexual assault between two male-identified individuals is (or may be) different than sexual assault between a male-identified individual and a female-identified or non-binary individual. Ignoring how sexism and male privilege operate and how their presence or absence changes the way our culture approaches, permits and encourages sexual harassment and assault against women is a different challenge than why and how sexual harassment and assault may occur for gay men.

Of course there can and will be overlap between the two and let’s also not forget that male privilege can and is weaponized against those who identify as femme men, but all of that just proves how complicated and insidious rape culture is for everyone. The big take away for me is that we should be having more and harder conversations about all of this ― not less or less nuanced ones.

That includes conversations about gay spaces and consent, especially when those spaces are often created to encourage and express sexual freedom (something I applaud) and lines can easily become blurred and easily be crossed (something I do not applaud). Non-consensual actions or activities are never OK but understanding how and when those actions or activities occur within these kind of spaces requires honest and complex discussions that go far beyond what Ambinder wrote.

So, let’s talk about why the man who refused to stop having sex with me may still to this day not have any clue that he assaulted me. Let’s talk about why it took me nine months and a clickbaity headline in USA Today for me to talk about my assault. Let’s talk about why I still have a hard time accepting that what happened was assault. Let’s talk about gay men spending more time interrogating their own behavior and the behavior of their friends and how we can be allies to those who are assaulted. And let’s talk about how all of this and more is or isn’t connected to the experiences of the women who were attacked by Weinstein ― and the countless others who are survivors. But we owe it to ourselves and each other not to be sloppy or slapdash about the connections we’re making or how we’re making them ― no matter how well-intentioned they may be ― especially at this incredibly important moment when these conversations are finally happening, or, more accurately, when the voices of survivors are finally beginning to be recognized, heard and believed."
http://wapo.st/2ztC67c?tid=ss_tw-bottom&utm_term=.b2b892750244,Perspective | #MeToo: I was raped by my pastor,[],2017-10-16T17:35:58Z,"Only Ezekiel 16:5—6, the graphic description of an exposed infant, approaches anywhere near it: “No eye looked on you with pity … you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised … then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood.”

I was 21 years old, barely five months after returning to the Christian faith. My rapist lived in the parsonage. He was young, serving as a youth pastor while attending a nearby seminary. I’d come roaring back to the faith after a brief dalliance with atheism and agnosticism. My enthusiasm quickly secured me a position on the leadership team for the youth group, within close working conditions of the youth pastor, although I considered him to be one of my own pastors.

Before long, I began to notice strange, questionable behaviors. Phone calls, flirtations, casual references to meeting with married women in the middle of the night. At first, I thought my perception unreliable — after all, he was the youth pastor, the seminarian. And I? A heathen whose discernment could hardly be trusted. But as the weeks wore on, I grew more confident in my assessment.

So one evening as we carpooled to a youth leadership meeting, I confronted him about his relationships with two married women in our church — mothers of children in the youth group. I mentioned all I had witnessed and brought up his confessions of regular midnight meetings with one of the women whenever her husband was away on business. His protestations of innocence were no match for the firmness of my judgment, and he finally admitted that both women were “in love” with him. He promised to break off the relationships if I would keep quiet.

He said as much himself, a week later, when he called to “apologize” and to say, “You were just too much of a temptation for me.” He had argued that sexual sins were not as significant as other sins, because sexual temptation came “from outside of him” and not from within his character.

The most difficult part was not the rape, that act of unspeakable violation. It was, and always has been, the horror of living in a body that has been raped. However much I believed in my mind that I was responsible for what had happened, my body knew better. In the months (and years) following the attack, I cringed in fear in the presence of any man — even my own father. One night, when he picked me up from work to take me to dinner, I skulked as far as I could from him against the car door. I hoped he wouldn’t notice me white-knuckling the door handle.

I feared I was losing my mind, until I had a conversation with my counseling professor. “Halee, this is so normal it has a name: post-traumatic stress disorder.” Knowing that I was not crazy gave me a foundation upon which to get well. Good friends, too, dug deep and challenged me to name that which had happened to me. “Halee, what happened to you was rape, and until you admit that, you will never be well.” And I wanted to be well.

We sometimes think that the choice of life and death is at the beginning of our walk with God, but this isn’t so. The task of the Christian life is to keep choosing life, over and over. There were times when the way of the grave seemed preferable to the harsh light of truth, times when the darkness, like a tempest, threatened to engulf me. But I wanted to live, so I kept choosing life, sometimes daily. Again, in Ezekiel 16, God said, “Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, ‘Live!’ ” So I did.

I’d always skeptically wondered why victims of sexual assault blame themselves. But in the days following the attack, I took full responsibility for it. No longer do I wonder. It’s because the shoulds, the woulds, and the what-ifs are persuasive illusions that trick you into believing that if you’d just done it all differently, the outcome would have been different. It’s psychologically easier to bear false guilt than to bear powerless vulnerability. As long as you are responsible, you are in control.

And in my case, there was a third reason. It was easier for me to bear responsibility than it was to bear the truth: that a person of the clergy — a person I believed was entrusted by God to shepherd others — was capable of so great a violation and crime.

My story — and the stories of countless others who have been the victims of sexual assault perpetrated by pastors — is a story of how fairy tales have failed us. “The Brothers Grimm” taught us that good and evil are visibly discernible. Good is always beautiful, and evil (excepting Snow White’s Evil Queen) is always ugly; heroines are flawless, while villains are deformed and grotesque. But in the real world, good and evil are not so nearly apparent as we might hope.

As Russian novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn understood, “The line separating good and evil passes … right through every human heart — and through all human hearts.” Yet we are reluctant to admit that monsters do not look as they do in our fairy tales and myths; they can look like us, like our pastors, the very people we believe God has entrusted to guide us. The world would seem safer and more controllable if beasts were sequestered to the Forbidden Forest, never lurking in our homes, our workplaces and our pulpits.

I wish this weren’t my story. With it, though, I hope to make all the good I can. My interest and vocational expertise in spiritual formation and leadership is not happenstance, nor did it arise out of mere intellectual curiosity. I write and teach on what it means for Christians, especially those in authority, to actually live and be like Jesus — through and through — so that maybe tomorrow, there will be fewer people with stories like mine.

The rape was the catalyst that changed the course of my life, and if this man had been the type of person he claimed to be, or if senior leadership had paid more attention to whom they let fill their pulpits, it never would have happened. My work is my way of fighting back, my way of beating back the darkness, now that I have strength."
http://ift.tt/2ysLwSf,#MeToo Floods Social Media With Stories of Harassment and Assault,['Anna Codrea-Rado'],2017-10-16T10:20:56.000Z,"Twitter bolstered the #MeToo trend by promoting it on Moments, its platform of curated stories.

The company pointed to its statement from last week in which it said it was “proud to empower and support the voices on our platform, especially those that speak truth to power.” It also noted that its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, had tweeted about the company’s efforts to tackle abuse on the site."
http://fb.me/1jdK0V6AO,On a Shockingly Casual Case of Sexual Assault,"['Mary Karr', 'Mary Kar r']",2016-08-11T00:00:35.000,"On a spring day in recent memory, I was strolling up Ninth Avenue alone, after leaving a bistro lunch with a gentleman caller and my soon-to-finish-N.Y.U. son. It was sunny but not yet steaming. Businessmen had their ties tugged loose or suit jackets slung over their shoulders. There were floral frocks and filmy blouses among the adorably pierced and punked-out goths of Hell’s Kitchen. I could almost feel the financial yoke of my son’s college tuition slipping off my neck.

Then an approaching guy chatting equably with a tall friend dodged at me to grab my crotch. I don’t mean brushed by it maybe accidentally; I mean he grabbed between my legs with a meaty claw, big as a waffle iron. He also called me the C-word with breath that stank of beer. Then he passed on into a sandwich shop with his buddy.

He wore a royal-blue plaid short-sleeve shirt you might find in a J. Crew ad, nicely hemmed jean shorts, and pricey sneakers. He was half my age and twice my weight and had the wide, muscled form cultivated by Equinox aficionados. Translation: he wasn’t dope sick or a flat-out loon.

In case you haven’t been on the receiving end of this sort of assault, you should know the primal physiological response it evokes—in this woman, anyway. The stomach drops, as if you’ve been shoved backward from a skyscraper and are flailing through space. Time dismantles. There are more frames per second, and people’s facial features become very specific. This guy had a squashed-down forehead, wide-set eyes, and heavy but neatly waxed brows.

Cops later told me my description was uncannily detailed—the result, I think, of the kind of change in perception post-traumatic-stress experts call “hypervigilance.” The reptilian area of the brain jolts you either to do battle or to bolt. Adrenaline and cortisol juice through you like a hit of meth, so you might find yourself still up and jittery at 4 A.M. (maybe even watching something as god-awful as “Waterworld,” the way I later did).

I stood outside the doorway of the sandwich shop—pulse pounding in my ears, my heart doing mule kicks in my chest. Inside, the Grabber, as I thought of him, was waiting in line to order a sandwich. He was fine; I was the one with the problem.

Shame hit, a cold backwash of elemental shame: something bad had been done to me; therefore I was bad. Even though I knew better, I started scanning for how I’d incited this. Pedestrians glided past. A sandwich was being made. I took stock of what I had on: in some ways, I wish I had been wearing booty shorts and Lucite heels and prissing past the Port Authority Bus Terminal holding my décolletage in my hands and saying “hubba hubba.” I should be able to dress that way if the urge possesses me.

Instead, I was wearing a modest dress and platform slides with big cork soles to save the feet from pounding concrete. For an instant, the shoes looked radiantly slutty, the old-maid equivalent of dominatrix spikes. I was drenched in sweat, and part of me wanted to bolt the two blocks to my apartment, scramble up the stairs, double-latch the door, and crawl behind some heavy furniture. But inside all that noise in my head, some space bar got hit, and a moment of quiet opened up.

One good side effect of a childhood as chaotic as my own is that I’ve worked up habits that can pay off in the middle of a butt-whipping. (I take twenty minutes of silence morning and night, and I see a therapist.) While the Grabber paid for his tidily wrapped sandwich, I noticed all the young women passing by—some, yes, in booty shorts, and with bodacious tatas—and I thought, If this sick bastard will do this to me in broad daylight, what’s he doing to these young’uns at 3 A.M.? My mind shuffled through the myriad times that run-ins like this had happened before. Then I came to and shouted from the doorway, “Not today! Not this bitch! You picked the wrong woman to fuck with today!”

The counter guy, bills in hand, craned around the line to see the madwoman outside. As the Grabber half-turned, the size of him shocked me and I backed away farther, to the other side of a parking meter, where my eyes could still shoot flying cartoon daggers at his broad back, albeit with some yardage between us.

Then a voice rose from the sidewalk. “What’d he do?” It was a man on a rectangle of cardboard you might normally step around.

“He grabbed”—polite words didn’t seem fierce enough, and the gross ones struck me as obscene—“my private zone!” This was the name my kid’s grade-school teacher had used for any area covered by a bathing suit: private zone.

So many guys might shrug it off: What’s the big deal? This one jutted his jaw out, saying, “He cain’t do that” with such fire that I started dialing 911. In a moment, I was on with a police dispatcher, describing the Grabber as he got his change and hustled out of the shop with his friend. They ignored me and started to get away, walking fast toward the bus station. My new friend on the cardboard said, “Go, go, go!” and I started to trot. They broke into a sprint, outpacing me right off.

Around Forty-first Street, a cop car pulled up, and I hopped in and recounted it all as they peeled out like they do on “Law & Order.” The female officer riding shotgun radioed the description I gave her to other cops, who nabbed him and hauled him, handcuffed, before me outside the Port Authority. “That’s him!” I said. He was blank-eyed, as if this whole thing were happening to somebody else. His buddy was amped up, though, claiming his friend hadn’t done anything. I shot back that that was horse hockey—yes, he had—and the buddy walked off as an officer put the Grabber in the back of a cruiser.

How satisfying was all this? Very.

En route to the station, the female officer looked back through the cage: Did I need counselling? I told her I’d had enough counselling to chase the sucker up Ninth Avenue. I only wanted to press charges.

I filed a report. Later they told me the guy was a thirty-something from Jersey. He had a light rap sheet with no record of sexual assault. Nobody ever called me to court, but the cops had cuffed him, dragged him out of the bus station, and booked him. A woman should be able to count on follow-through from the justice system—they’d eventually fail to charge him—but at least he spent a night at Rikers. At the time, I felt somewhat vindicated.

For days after, I kept chewing on what thrill the Grabber got from his move. It just won’t translate to my gender. There are plenty of guys I might fancy kissing on the mouth, but to grab a passing one in the crotch and say, nice package? One pal joked, “Oh, yeah, try it,” suggesting that, for men, any sexual overture is welcome. I asked how he’d feel if a fellow weighing three-forty cornered him somewhere isolated and manhandled him. Suddenly this struck him as way more sinister."

https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/09/19/ellen-pao-asian-women-tech-glass-ceiling-bamboo-ceiling/665822001/,It's called the 'Pao effect' — Asian women in tech are fighting deep-rooted discrimination,[],,"SAN FRANCISCO — Sysamone Phaphon felt lucky when, after quitting her job in health care to start a tech company, she was approached by an investor at a pitch competition.

It was only after the investor lured her on a business trip to New York that she realized the offer to help her raise money was a ruse to sleep with her.

Phaphon says it's an all too common experience for Asian women to get sexually harassed in the tech industry, part of routine discrimination that hampers their careers.

""I wasn’t the only woman at the pitch competition,"" says Phaphon, founder of FilmHero, a Web app for independent filmmakers. ""I was the one he hit on because I was Asian.""

By most measures, Asians and Asian Americans are well represented in tech, with 41% of jobs in Silicon Valley's top companies. Though Asian women hold fewer of those jobs than Asian men, they're employed in far greater numbers than other women of color, leading some to assume they do not face the same levels of discrimination as African Americans and Latinas.

Yet research from Joan C. Williams, a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law, shows that Asian women report experiencing as much bias, and sometimes more, than other women do. And Asian women are the demographic group that is the least represented in the executive suite relative to their percentage in the workforce, according to a study of major San Francisco Bay Area tech companies by the nonprofit Ascend Foundation.

""Asian women face a double whammy of racial and gender discrimination,” says Bo Ren, who worked as a product manager at Facebook and Tumblr.

Fighting to crack that leadened combination of glass ceiling and bamboo ceiling is the subject of Ellen Pao's new tell-all memoir out Tuesday.

Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change details the legal battle against her former venture capital firm that captivated Silicon Valley and brought attention to discrimination against women, in particular Asian women. Pao accused Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers of not promoting her because of her gender and retaliating against her for complaining. She lost on all counts.

In Reset, Pao recalls going to work for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers' John Doerr as his chief of staff. He picked her, she says, because he liked the idea of a ""Tiger Mom-raised"" woman. He had two chiefs of staff, the other one a man who focused mostly on investing, while she was asked to help with email, speeches, even babysitting his daughter and other ""less desirable work."" ""There are certain things I am just more comfortable asking a woman to do,"" Pao recalls Doerr telling her.

""Some of us lose and some of us win,"" Pao writes to women in Reset. ""What's important is that we're telling our stories and standing up for ourselves and for each other.""

That's what some women have been doing since Pao filed her lawsuit in 2012, putting their careers on the line to call out companies and individuals that engaged in discrimination — and got away with it. In Silicon Valley, it's called the ""Pao effect.""

Software engineer Tracy Chou pressured some of technology’s most powerful companies to release annual demographic reports on their workforces, revealing just how few women and people of color they employ.

Female entrepreneurs, many of them Asian, stepped forward to expose the predatory behavior of tech investors who sexually harassed women, leading to those investors’ resignations and promises from the tech industry to reform.

Phaphon says the example set by Pao and others gave her the courage to tell her story. ""Only if we are willing to speak up will we be able to change the stereotypes,"" Phaphon says.

Typecast as meek, compliant and domestic, Asian women working in the tech industry say they are frequently pressured into traditionally feminine roles. They get stuck with office housework such as organizing team lunches and with grunt work such as fixing software bugs.

With fewer ""stretch"" assignments that advance their careers, they say they encounter more bias on performance reviews and get overlooked for promotions and pay raises. When they assert or promote themselves, they say they're penalized.

It's not just in big tech companies that Asian women face challenges. When pitching investors, Asian women entrepreneurs say they're told they speak too softly or that they should bring on a male co-founder. They are mistaken for other Asian women. And, they say, they get propositioned all the time.

Beatrice Kim sued her former employer BetterWorks and its then chief executive officer Kris Duggan in July, claiming he assaulted her in a sexually suggestive manner during a company retreat and permitted a hostile work environment in which vulgar remarks were made about women. After the lawsuit was filed, Duggan said he would step down as CEO to take the role of president.

In 2015, Chia Hong, a Taiwanese product manager, sued Facebook, saying her opinions were belittled or ignored in meetings, she was told she looked differently and talked differently than other team members and her boss had her organize parties and serve drinks to male colleagues. Hong dropped her case.

A former software engineer at Twitter, Tina Huang says when she complained the promotion process at the social media company was stacked against women, she was placed on administrative leave. Huang, ‎who's co-founder and chief technology officer of venture-funded tech startup Transposit, sued Twitter and in November is seeking class action status for the other female engineers she says were passed over.

Ellen Pao says it's time for a tech industry reset

After Uber, more women speak up about Silicon Valley sexism

""The story we tell ourselves is that Asian Americans are hardworking and industrious, meek and great at math, conforming, apolitical and, thus, upwardly mobile — but only up to a point,"" says Tina Lee, founder and CEO of MotherCoders.org, which trains women with kids for tech jobs. ""We make great worker bees but we're not leadership material. This is doubly true for API (Asian-Pacific Islander) women.""

Lee is the assertive and plain-spoken founder of a tech nonprofit. She says people often comment that she's ""unconventional.""

""People expect me to be a certain way and I show up another way. I am no more extroverted and loud than many white women I know, but I'm perceived as being unconventional because I'm not the meek Hello Kitty or the cold dragon lady they expect,"" she says.

Asian and Asian American women tend to get lumped into one highly educated, over-achieving, upwardly mobile category, obscuring the wide range of experiences in the Asian and Asian-American populations, from those who grow up economically disadvantaged to immigrant workers from a variety of different cultures.

From all appearances, entrepreneur and investor Susan Wu is your typical successful, Ivy League-educated Asian-American woman who has advised a who's who of tech companies, including Medium, Twitter and Square.

What people don't know is that she had an abusive childhood marred by poverty and was shuttled to be with relatives when her mentally ill parents couldn't care for her, she says.

""As an Asian American woman, I'm either a caricature object of sexual interest, a nerdy engineer, a newly arrived immigrant, a tiger mom or an aggressive dragon lady,"" Wu says.

Earlier this year, Wu spoke out about sexual harassment in the industry, saying that she was propositioned by Binary Capital investor Justin Caldbeck while she was fundraising in 2010. Many of the women who went public with allegations that they were sexually harassed by Caldbeck were Asian, too.

""I've been working in tech for 25 years and I'm still waiting to be treated as a whole human being as a default, not as an exception,"" she says.

Even with so many constraints, Asian women are making their mark in tech, from holding management jobs in major tech companies to running their own start-ups and venture funds. And that's lighting the way for others.

Every time Gladys Kong attends a tech conference, someone walks up to her and asks her a marketing or sales question while her male colleagues fields technical questions.

“I either have to wear a sign that I am an engineer or I have to show them I know what I am talking about,"" says Kong. “Yet I am the one behind building the product.”

Not only that, she's the one leading the company. Kong is CEO of mobile location and data company UberMedia and she's working to crack the stereotypical mold of what qualifies someone to be a leader in tech.

Kong didn't speak much English when she immigrated to the U.S. in high school. She focused on math and science, as she did in Hong Kong, and fell in love with programming. She worked at business incubator Idealab, started her own company and then in 2012 joined UberMedia.

Still not the first one to pipe up in a meeting, Kong says she prefers instead to listen to all ideas before sharing her opinion. But she is spending more time on the speaking circuit, determined to show young Asian women that there's room in the tech world for them, including at the top.

“Looking around you don’t see a lot of Asian women role models,” Kong says. “If I can inspire somebody to step up and do what they want to do, that is awesome to me.”

Every 98 seconds someone in the U.S. is sexually assaulted. That means every single day more than 570 people experience sexual violence in this country.

Since the first step toward preventing sexual violence is understanding the reality of it, we’ve rounded up 30 statistics that show just how insidious it is for National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.

Sexual violence is a problem that is deeply rooted in our culture, and these numbers prove that.

The estimated number of women who have been the victims of rape since 1998.

The age range that women are four times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault. Female college students ages 18-24 are three times more likely than women in the general population to experience sexual violence.

The fraction of American women who have survived an attempted or completed rape in their lifetimes.

The amount of times trans people of color are more likely to experience sexual violence than the general population.

The average number of victims of rape and sexual assault per year in the U.S.

The percentage of instances of sexual violence experienced by inmates that are perpetrated by jail or prison staff.

The number of times a person with a disability is more likely to be a victim of sexual assault or rape than a person without a disability.

The percentage of sexual contact between inmates and prison guards that is illegal and, therefore, non-consensual.

The amount of money it costs to get a rape kit tested. According to the Violence Against Women Act, a survivor should never have to pay for their own rape kit, but many states have loopholes that force survivors to do just that.

The age range in which people are most likely to be sexually assaulted.

The fraction of military service members who experienced an assault at the hands of someone in their chain of command.

The amount of money sexual violence and abuse cost the U.S. in 2008 alone."

http://dlvr.it/Pw2s4X,"Iraq, Catalonia, #MeToo: Your Tuesday Briefing",['Patrick Boehler'],2017-10-17T04:03:07.000Z,"130 million years ago, while dinosaurs still walked the Earth, a pair of dead stars collided. The explosion rattled spacetime and sent waves of light across the universe. On August 17, 2017, light from that explosion appeared as a bright pinprick in the galaxy NGC 4993, then faded to a glowing red ember. Ripples of traumatized spacetime from the distant explosion squeezed and stretched the L-shaped arms of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Converted to sound waves, the ripples produced a faint rising chirp. Two seconds later, NASA’s Fermi space telescope detected a gamma ray burst. A brief glint of high-energy radiation from one of the most violent events in nature. Astronomers raced to point their telescopes before the precious light faded away. First on the scene was the Swope telescope in Chile. Right on its heels was the nearby Dark Energy Camera. The antennas of the Very Large Array strained to record radio emissions from the fireball. Even the Hubble space telescope turned its peerless mirror toward NGC 4993. Within hours, the distant explosion had become one of the most observed events in recent astronomical history. Astronomers think the story began with a pair of massive stars that were orbiting each other. The larger star ran out of fuel and collapsed into a dense neutron star. Neutron stars are the densest visible objects in the universe, spinning dervishes bristling with powerful magnetic fields. A teaspoonful of this starstuff would weigh as much as Mount Everest. The intense gravity of the neutron star began to steal gas from its aging sister star. The swirl of hot gas dragged the two stars together until the neutron star began orbiting inside its sister, shredding its outer layers into a swirling cloud of elements. But the sister star survived this mutilation, and eventually exploded, too. Collapsing into a second neutron star. The fuse was now lit for one final cataclysm. Twin spheres of incredible density were now locked in an ever tightening dance of doom. Shedding energy in the form of gravitational waves, the two neutron stars spiralled closer and closer, faster and faster. And finally merged in a moment of astrophysical ecstasy. A kilonova explosion. A crucible for cosmic alchemy. The swirling cloud of superheated atoms was bombarded with neutrons, forging new atoms of gold and platinum and other heavy elements. Scientists think most of the precious metals in the universe were created in kilonova explosions like these. When black holes collide there is nothing to see, though LIGO can hear the chirp from their gravitational waves. But neutron stars are visible matter, and collide within a glowing cloud. This was the first gravitational-wave catastrophe that astronomers saw as well as heard. Our first glimpse of the mysterious physics inside neutron stars. And a first fleeting glimpse of a cosmic mint in the sky."

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/16/untested-rape-kits-evidence-across-usa/29902199/,Tens of thousands of rape kits go untested across USA,[],2015-07-16T13:04:36.507Z,"After 18 years without justice, Joanie Scheske believed the man who raped her would never be caught.

That changed when St. Louis police called in 2009. Evidence in a separate, eight-year old sexual assault was finally tested and matched her attacker's DNA.

Rapist Mark Frisella, whose attack was so brutal Scheske still suffers from epilepsy, is serving 19 years in prison.

""I had a really difficult time wrapping my head around why that rape kit was never tested,"" Scheske said. ""My case is a poster child as to why you test these kits.""

A USA TODAY Media Network investigation identified tens of thousands of sexual assault evidence kits never tested by police.

In the most detailed nationwide inventory of untested rape kits ever, USA TODAY and journalists from more than 75 Gannett newspapers and TEGNA TV stations have found at least 70,000 neglected kits in an open-records campaign covering 1,000-plus police agencies – and counting. Despite its scope, the agency-by-agency count covers a fraction of the nation's 18,000 police departments, suggesting the number of untested rape kits reaches into the hundreds of thousands.

The kits contain forensic evidence collected from survivors in a painstaking and invasive process that can last four to six hours. Testing can yield DNA evidence that helps identify suspects, bolster prosecutions and in some cases exonerate the wrongly accused.

The records reveal widespread inconsistency in how police handle rape evidence from agency to agency, and even officer to officer. Some departments test every rape kit. Others send as few as two in 10 to crime labs.

Decades of promises from politicians, and more than $1 billion in federal funding, has failed to fix the problems. The roughly $1,000 cost to analyze each kit is among the hindrances for police.

Records obtained from police agencies in all 50 states show:
• While attention has been focused on large metro police agencies, tens of thousands of untested sexual assault kits are accumulating almost without notice at rural and smaller city departments. Hundreds of rape kits remain untested in places like Muncie, Ind., Visalia, Calif., St. Cloud, Minn., and Green Bay, Wis.
• In most states and at most law enforcement agencies, there are no written guidelines for processing sex-crime evidence. Decisions often are left to the discretion of investigating officers, leading to inconsistencies.
• Although uploading offenders' DNA information into state and national databases is proven to identify serial predators who move across jurisdictions, police often treat rape kits as if the evidence is relevant only to the single assault with which it is associated.
• Authorities at all levels of government are failing to quantify the problem. At least 50 major law enforcement agencies — from Montgomery, Ala., to Reno, Nev. — have never counted the untested rape kits in their evidence rooms. Most states haven't undertaken an inventory.
• The U.S. Department of Justice is failing to comply with a 2013 law that was meant to get more rape kits tested and set national protocols for processing sexual assault evidence.

For rape survivors like Scheske, the accumulation of untested evidence is more than abstract statistics.

""Every single one of those rape kits is a person, and (their) family and friends,"" she said. ""It's like a baby's mobile: You touch one piece and it moves all the others. It's not just one person. Everyone that their sphere of influence touches is affected by what happens to a victim.""

Debbie Smith of Williamsburg, Va., is one of thousands whose cases were solved by DNA analysis. After a masked man invaded her home in 1989 and raped her — threatening to come back and kill her if she told anyone — she lived in constant fear of his return for more than six years.

Smith remembers the day she was notified that a DNA match identified her attacker. He was already behind bars in Maryland for another crime. ""It was the first time in those 6½ years that I took a deliberate breath. I wanted to breathe. I wanted to live.""

The inconsistent analysis of rape kits persists even as comprehensive testing in some cities — including New York, Cleveland and Detroit — has demonstrated the power of the previously unused evidence to identify unknown assailants, confirm the accounts of sexual assault survivors, and exonerate wrongly accused suspects.

The results showed the discretion investigating officers have over whether to test rape kits has often been misused, said Sarah Haacke Byrd, managing director of the Joyful Heart Foundation, a group pushing for testing of all kits tied to a reported sexual assault.

""Time and time again, we have seen that law enforcement frequently disbelieves victims when they're seeking help from law enforcement,"" she said. Mandatory testing ""takes discretion out of the hands of law enforcement.""

In the course of this investigation, the questions from local and national journalists started prompting change, even before publication. State agencies and local police that didn't know how many untested rape kits they held started counting because of reporters' questions and open records requests. Those new audits alone found more than 2,000 kits containing untested evidence. Several agencies decided, based on reporters' inquiries, to send some or all of their untested rape kits to crime labs. In South Carolina, told of the findings, legislative leaders began pursuing statewide standards defining when police should test rape evidence.

Yet for uncounted thousands more rape survivors, the evidence remains untested, in storage.

It took more than a decade for Michael J. Brown to face justice for the 1993 rape of a school-aged girl at a New York City apartment complex.

On Aug. 6, 1993, Brown followed the girl inside a Queens apartment building where she was visiting a friend. He placed his hand over her mouth and abducted her, taking her to the rooftop, where he raped her and knocked her unconscious with a brick, according to court records.

The victim was taken to a local hospital, where she was interviewed by police and a rape kit was prepared. Then, for nine years, that evidence sat in a freezer among a trove of 16,000 untested rape kits held by the New York City Police Department.

In prior decades, the evidence had little value unless new leads emerged. But DNA technology advanced and state and federal governments built offender databases. Police and policymakers saw value in analyzing the evidence.

In the late 1990s, NYPD spent $12 million to send every kit to a private lab for analysis. About 2,000 matched DNA in offender databases — ""cold hits"" as police call them. One of the matches: Michael Brown.

His DNA had been entered into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) database after an unrelated crime in Maryland. The DNA match led to his indictment in 2003 for the New York girl's rape. He was convicted in 2005.

Other cities and several states followed New York's example and now send all rape kits for testing. New laws and changing attitudes in some jurisdictions have led to CODIS matches resulting in thousands of new investigations and hundreds of indictments — many involving serial offenders tied to sex crimes in different parts of the country.

Testing by Cleveland-area prosecutors linked more than 200 alleged serial rapists to 600 assaults. Statewide, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's effort to collect and test sexual assault kits has resulted in at least 2,285 CODIS hits so far.

In Houston, analysis of about 6,600 untested rape kits resulted in about 850 matches, 29 prosecutions and six convictions.

And, since the Colorado Bureau of Investigation began requiring police statewide to submit sexual assault kits for testing last year, more than 150 matches have been found.

Despite those successes, many police agencies haven't changed their policies.

In New York state, law enforcement agencies outside of New York City are under no legal requirement to test rape evidence. No state law exists requiring agencies to track how many untested kits are stored in their evidence rooms.

New York is one of 44 states with no law stipulating when police should test rape kits and 34 states that haven't conducted a statewide inventory.

""We need to have a full accounting for the state of what's left, what hasn't been tested, why it hasn't been tested and just clear it up,"" said New York State Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, a Democrat, who has introduced legislation requiring an inventory. The bill has yet to make it out of committee.

Interviews with law enforcement officials, and a review of police records obtained by USA TODAY, reveal sexual-assault-kit testing is often arbitrary and inconsistent among law enforcement agencies — and even within agencies.

In Jackson, Tenn., for example, notations in evidence records show contradictory reasons as to why rape kits were not tested. In some cases, the Jackson Police Department did not test evidence because the suspect's identity was already known, records show. In 13 other cases since 1998, records show police decided not to test kits because there was ""no suspect"" or ""no known suspect,"" even though testing the kits could help identify a suspect.

Another untested sexual assault kit held by the Jackson Police Department is from a 2005 case where a woman was found under a car and told police in two separate interviews she was raped after using drugs with a man in a hotel, according to case records.

""She asked (him to) stop but he continued to have sexual intercourse with her,"" the investigator wrote in one report. But the investigator's notes from a third interview days later indicate ""she did not remember what had happened"" and the sex was voluntary. The case was closed. The sexual assault kit had not been tested as of last month.

""That should have been investigated further and I feel confident that it would be now,"" Jackson Police Capt. Mike Holt said of the case, noting changes over the past decade in how police interact with victims.

Law enforcement officials said the most common reason kits are not tested is there is not a prosecutable case, usually due to a lack of cooperation from victims.

Perceived lack of cooperation from a victim is not a valid reason to jettison forensic evidence, said Mai Fernandez, executive director of the National Crime Victims Center, a Washington-based non-profit. Some survivors may fear retaliation if they press charges.

""The victim might not decide that they want to go forward with the case, but they might decide later on that they do,"" Fernandez said. ""Or, if there's enough circumstantial evidence, including the kit, a jurisdiction could decide to go forward without the victim.""

Some government officials and researchers have faulted police for a predisposition to doubt survivors' stories.

""The fact is that often rape kits are unsubmitted for testing because of a blame-the-victim mentality or because investigators mistrust the survivor's story,"" Illinois Attorney General Madigan told a U.S. Senate subcommittee at a hearing in May. ""This outdated way of thinking must change.""

After more than 10,000 untested sexual assault kits were discovered in Detroit in 2008, a landmark study funded by the Justice Department faulted police for ""negative, victim‐blaming beliefs.""

""Rape survivors were often assumed to be prostitutes and therefore what had happened to them was considered to be their own fault,"" researchers from Michigan State University wrote in their analysis of Detroit's rape investigations.

At some agencies, records reviewed by USA TODAY show untested sexual assault kits come from cases involving child victims.

Records from the Dallas Police Department show at least 43 sexual assault kits taken into custody from 1996 to 1999 were from children, some as young as 12. In an interview, Dallas police officials said there are likely many more kits from children among its inventory of more than 4,000, but there are no plans to specifically target them for testing.

""Often, someone will say that they were victimized. But when you get into the case, actually what it is, is that their parent had told them not to go visit a friend, so they had to make up a story,"" said Dallas police spokesman Major Jeff Cotner, who noted that testing of older kits could delay testing that is more urgently needed for current investigations.

Many law enforcement officials are adamant in their defense of leaving some kits untested.

At about $1,000 per kit, officials said submitting a rape kit for testing unnecessarily could divert resources from other policing needs or delay testing of evidence in cases where the need for analysis is more urgent.

""The kit itself isn't always the best science or the best evidence to a case,"" said Sgt. Trent Crump, spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department, which has accumulated 1,782 untested rape kits since 2000. He said the agency uses an ""evidence-based testing procedure"" to decide in each case.

""I think that in cities that have started testing all of their backlog, they're finding enough patterns of serial rapists for the information to be really valuable in current cases as well as the ones that have been sitting on shelves for years,"" said Scott Berkowitz, president of the non-profit Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.

Over the past decade, Congress has appropriated about $1.2 billion to cut the nation's backlog of DNA testing needs, including sexual assault kits. In other terms: enough to test 1 million rape kits.

In 2013, Congress passed legislation to focus federal spending and set national testing standards. The Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry Act, or SAFER Act, required at least three-quarters of the funding for sexual assault kits be used for testing or taking inventory of the evidence. The law set up grants to help local police pay for inventories and testing. No grants have been awarded. A Justice Department steering committee met only once, in March 2014.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who authored the law, called it ""completely unconscionable"" that the Justice Department has not complied.

With federal action stalled, changes in how sexual assault evidence is treated is falling to state and local officials. As more cold hits emerge, some law enforcement leaders have started to advocate for more stringent record-keeping and testing policies.

Col. Elmer Setting, who leads the New Castle Police Department in Delaware, said he has pushed for a statewide mandate to test every rape kit.

""They've had success stories with testing these kits,"" he said. ""It's amazing how, (for) many of these sexual predators, we have their DNA and we never tested the kit. It doesn't make any sense.""

In addition to New York, bills are pending in other states — including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Maryland — to require inventories of untested rape kits. In five states, legislation is pending requiring testing of any new rape kits.

The mandatory testing bills being considered in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia would add to testing laws on the books in Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Texas and Washington.

""If we could catch more rapists through testing,"" said Rosenthal, the New York lawmaker, ""we ought to test every single kit we have."""

http://strib.mn/2gJcUSi,#MeToo floods social media with stories of sexual assault to raise awareness,[],2017-11-06T12:31:33.977Z,"LOS ANGELES — Thousands of women are identifying themselves as victims of sexual harassment or assault following a call to action propelled by actress Alyssa Milano in the wake of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein's downfall over of allegations of sexual misconduct spanning decades.

Milano passed along a suggestion from a friend on Sunday that women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted post ""me too"" to ""give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.""

The campaign quickly trended on Twitter and Facebook, with notable names like Lady Gaga, Monica Lewinsky and Rosario Dawson identifying themselves as victims. Others shared personal stories.

""Being raped once made it easier to be raped again. I instinctually shut down. My body remembered, so it protected me. I disappeared. #metoo,"" actress Evan Rachel Wood wrote as part of a series of tweets on her experience. ""Sharing my stories and feeling less alone really helps. So thank you for listening.""

Some women weighed in with stories of assaults while in the military, gang rapes and catcalls.

Milano's former co-star on TV's ""Charmed,"" Rose McGowan, tweeted in support of the campaign. McGowan has accused Weinstein of raping her.

Milano called the Weinstein allegations ""disturbing"" in an essay last week, but added that she had been reluctant to comment publicly because of her friendship with Weinstein's wife, Georgina Chapman.

""I am constantly part of this conversation even if I don't publicly comment on specific scandals,"" she wrote. ""Sexual harassment and assault in the workplace are not just about Harvey Weinstein. We must change things in general. We must do better for women everywhere.""

A similar social media campaign is playing out on Instagram among models who are sharing stories of abuse and harassment in the fashion industry.

Model Cameron Russell put out a post four days ago offering help to models and has been deluged with responses. She has shared many on her Instagram feed, blacking out identifying factors but leaving the stories otherwise alone.

http://bit.ly/2yhEW1h,Nolte: Lisa Bloom Accused of Shady Tactics to Shield Amazon's Alleged Sexual Harasser,['John Nolte'],2017-10-14T13:45:03+00:00,"Just last week, after a year of standing beside those accusing Bill Cosby, Bill O’Reilly, and President Trump of sexual misconduct (all three deny any wrongdoing), 56-year-old Lisa Bloom seemed on the verge of stepping into her mother Gloria Allred’s shoes as America’s premier left-wing, feminist attorney.

Today Bloom’s reputation is a dumpster fire, her career almost certainly doornail dead. If you thought Bloom was road kill over her wildly incompetent defense of Harvey Weinstein and the explosive news that this incompetency included a ham-handed suggestion to discredit the Oscar-winning producer’s accusers, The Hollywood Reporter’s Kim Masters is now claiming that Bloom engaged in highly unethical tactics to shield yet-another high-powered executive accused of sexual harassment, Amazon Studios chief Roy Price.

Masters is the journalist behind Thursday’s bombshell report detailing Price’s alleged harassment of TV producer Isa Hackett. Within hours of its publication, Price was put on indefinite suspension.

According to Masters, she has been working on this story for months and nailed it enough in August so that at least part of the story — without the vulgar details — ran at a tech site.

Other than convincing Hackett to go on the record, (something she agreed to do Thursday as the Weinstein scandal unfurled), her biggest stumbling block was Bloom, who, according to Masters, went so far as to threaten crippling lawsuits:

In my case, one of Bloom’s tactics was to try to kill the story by telling multiple outlets that I had approached Price and Amazon for money to support my radio show. There was no truth to this, as I had never asked either for funding. In her zeal to protect her client … Boom claimed that I had turned on Price after he rebuffed my demand to have Amazon underwrite The Business, the public-radio show that I host on KCRW. I can’t guess who concocted that allegation, but I assume the idea was to establish a potential argument that I had behaved unethically and had a personal grudge against him and therefore didn’t care what the facts were. Over the weeks that would follow, as I began searching for a home for my scoop, [attorney Charles] Harder and Bloom convinced every publication that considered my story that they weren’t just threatening legal action but would indeed sue.

This fills in an awful lot of gaps. What seemed like a footnote on Thursday now makes a whole lot more sense. After Masters dropped her Thursday bomb on Price, Deadline reported that Bloom was no longer representing the Amazon exec. “My representation of Roy Price has concluded,” she said.“It concluded before the producer went public.”

Weasel words aside, it appeared as though Bloom had at least dodged this bullet. In other words, she knew to dump Price before the allegations hit the fan, something she was not smart enough to do with Weinstein.

But if the Masters’ story is accurate — and we have no reason to believe otherwise — Bloom only bailed after it became clear that her shady tactics had failed to shield yet another powerful man accused of abusing women.

The connection between Weinstein and Price, obviously, is a gateway into the bright lights of Tinseltown. Bloom had a miniseries deal with Weinstein, and Price has been Mr. Greenlight as Amazon Studios expands exponentially.

My guess is that Bloom’s dream of strolling down the red carpet in her mother’s shoes is now over.

After all, as long as it furthers The Cause, the Beautiful People in Hollywood and the national media are willing to forgive almost anything … anything but incompetence. And outside of her own grasping greed and self-interest, Bloom just does not appear to be all that bright.

http://wapo.st/2ifgg36,Opinion | #MeToo is spreading. Are men getting let off the hook?,[],2017-10-16T18:40:19Z,"The raw numbers certainly succeeded in conveying the scope of the problem, Milano’s goal. Yet as I scrolled through the posts on social media, all I could feel was weariness. After all, this is far from the first effort to use social media to raise awareness about sexual harassment and assault, and not the first that asks women to share their pain while men get to be passive observers. There was #YesAllWomen in 2014, which discussed misogyny and violence against women after Elliot Rodger killed six people in Isla Vista, Calif., an attack seemingly inspired by his hatred for women. There was #NotOkay a year ago, after The Post reported on an “Access Hollywood” video in which then-candidate Donald Trump bragged about assaulting women. That was followed up by #WhyWomenDontReport, once Trump’s surrogates attempted to discredit the women who said Trump had assaulted them.

And it’s not just social media: In 2011, women started organizing SlutWalk marches to protest victim-blaming attitudes around sexual assault, with many marchers carrying heartbreaking signs detailing their experiences of assault and harassment. As sexual assault survivors have organized on college campuses, many have come forward to speak to the media about their experiences in detail. Take Back the Night first started in the 1970s and continues on college campuses and in cities across the world. Women are asked to show their scars, to speak about their traumas, to make experiences public. Which raises the question: When can we move past describing the violence against women and move toward demanding that the perpetrators — and the people who enable them — change their behavior?

This is not meant as a critique of the women who are speaking out. I know that talking about assault and harassment can be an empowering step. (Yes, me too, of course.) But this collective display of trauma can too easily allow others, men especially, to offer sympathetic comments and social-media “likes” without being forced to reflect on their own actions. Do they need to change the way they treat women? Do they look the other way or make excuses when they find out that someone they know has assaulted someone else? What other signals are they sending that say sexual violence will go unpunished? (Trump did get elected president after the “Access Hollywood” video and assault allegations came out, after all.)

There are already a few models of constructive ways forward. Bystander-intervention programs have some proven success in getting people to intervene more often. And going back to hashtags, activist Feminista Jones began the hashtag #YouOkSis in 2014 not only for women, particularly black women, to share stories of street harassment, but also to share tips to protect women and de-escalate harassment as a bystander.

Colin Firth recently expressed his “shame” that he hadn’t acted when a co-worker told him about a “distressing encounter” with Weinstein. But if men don’t allow that shame to push them toward action, there will continue to be more Harvey Weinsteins and Roger Aileses and Bill O’Reillys and Bill Cosbys and other alleged abusers who aren’t famous but still harass and hurt women. Here’s to hoping the next hashtag that emerges around sexual violence will be from men collectively working to decrease violence and harassment against women. #MenToo have a role to play."

http://ift.tt/2hIVUuW,#MeToo: survivors testify to the impossibility of preempting sexual assault,['Aja Romano'],2017-10-16T12:30:02-04:00,"Widespread outrage over the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations continued to play out on social media over the weekend — this time through #MeToo, a powerful hashtag aimed at illustrating that anyone can be a victim of sexual harassment.

The hashtag was spurred primarily by an opinion piece in the New York Times, “Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein's World,” which was written by The Big Bang Theory’s Mayim Bialik and quickly went viral. Bialik argued that women are essentially harassed on a hierarchical tier based on how attractive they are and how they dress.

The argument was an affront to many readers, who rushed to point out that in reality, women of all types are harassed. As discussion of Bialik’s op-ed continued, actress Alyssa Milano suggested that women reply “me too” to a single tweet:

This isn’t the first time the idea of testifying to sexual assault through the framing of a “me too” has gained traction. An earlier ""Me Too"" movement was started over a decade ago by black feminist Tarana Burke, to empower other black women and girls who are sexual assault survivors.

Milano wasn’t aware of that background until Vox reached her for comment Monday evening, whereupon she tweeted noting the movement’s origin story, which she described as “heartbreaking and inspiring.”

But the idea resonated with many women and other survivors, who responded to Milano’s original tweet and passed it on.

The idea spread rapidly, as women began speaking about their experiences with sexual harassment and assault on both Twitter and Facebook, and the #MeToo hashtag was born.

In her op-ed, Bialik painted herself as being savvy enough to preemptively ward off sexual assault

Bialik’s op-ed piece in the Times was framed as an account of her personal experience with rigorous beauty standards in Hollywood relative to the Weinstein scandal. Her argument was two-pronged: She suggested that Hollywood’s emphasis on extreme beauty has insulated her from the worst forms of harassment throughout her career, and she described the acts of “self-protection” — including dressing down and modifying her behavior — that have helped her ward off unwanted attention from men.

“As a proud feminist with little desire to diet, get plastic surgery or hire a personal trainer, I have almost no personal experience with men asking me to meetings in their hotel rooms,” she wrote. “Those of us in Hollywood who don’t represent an impossible standard of beauty have the ‘luxury’ of being overlooked and, in many cases, ignored by men in power unless we can make them money.”

While Bialik acknowledged that “Nothing — absolutely nothing — excuses men for assaulting or abusing women,” she went on to declare that women “can’t be naïve about the culture we live in,” explaining that she makes “choices” she deems “self-protecting and wise.”

“I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with,” she wrote. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.”

Many people who read the piece felt that it amounted to victim blaming, and that Bialik was unforgivably asking potential targets of sexual assault to be responsible for curbing the behavior of predatory men. But the more widespread backlash was reserved for Bialik’s suggestion that only pretty women experience harassment and assault.

In particular, numerous actresses spoke out, with many saying that their own experiences with sexual assault didn’t align with what Bialik was arguing.

Bialik’s own experience also didn’t align with those of the thousands of survivors who trended the #MeToo hashtag in response.

Words of support and empowerment were also widespread.

There were also calls for men to do more to combat harassment, instead of relying on women to do so by sharing their stories:

Twitter’s ongoing role in the discussion wasn’t forgotten either:

Bialik responded to the backlash Sunday night, tweeting that her words had been taken out of context.

There was, however, at least one chilling reminder that the “too ugly to be raped” myth is alive and well:

Update: This story has been updated to include the historical context of the “me too” movement started by Tarana Burke over a decade ago."

One early morning when I was especially tired, my makeup artist said it might be a good idea, and then I guess I got hooked. The pressure all women feel to pursue a glossy ideal is magnified when you’re on TV. Not just the eyelashes, but the heavy makeup too. I still remember the day I rushed home after my show without taking off my makeup. My son Christian took one look at me and cried, alarmed, “Mommy what happened to your face?” These days my kids and everyone else are more likely to see me without makeup, and the reprieve has been liberating. I’ve been stripped of a face that may have looked glamorous, and I’ve gone back to the basics. It may seem like a small thing, but it’s a powerful metaphor for what I’ve been through. For me, going back to the basics is not just an external reality. It means getting in touch with the person inside — who I am off the set as well as on. And re-examining what really matters beneath the surface.

I was incredibly touched by his words. I mean, I trashed his car, even if it was an accident! But he was able to look beyond his personal loss and outrage and feel empathy for me, and I treasured his response for that reason. It showed me once again that when we can look beyond our own lives and feel someone else’s reality, it creates a miraculous connection. I’ve learned on countless occasions in the last year that people can be so kind and caring. It’s made me take stock of the ways I can also turn everyday encounters into meaningful human moments. I’ve found that no one is a stranger in the instant of contact. We hear a lot about how our modern culture has an “empathy deficit”—but each of us can turn that trend around by reaching beyond our personal problems and truly seeing what others are going through.

I opened the garage door and waved my arms at the bird, hoping he’d fly away. When he didn’t budge, I realized that maybe he couldn’t fly. Or maybe he was afraid to try. (I know what that feels like! I had my own moment of deciding to take a big leap without knowing if I’d land on my feet.) What to do? I left the garage door open and returned to the kitchen, but the anguished little chirps kept coming, distracting me from the work at hand. Finally, I called the local animal control office, looking for advice, and they promised to send someone out. Within an hour, two very serious and professional khaki-clad agents were standing in my garage studying the situation. All this for a tiny bird — I was impressed!

I was elated when the tests revealed nothing to worry about, but the sensation of letting go of all my petty concerns felt familiar. I found myself remembering a terrifying incident the previous year. I’d been flying back to the United States from a trip to Croatia with my husband and friends. We’d changed our flight at the last minute to leave more time to make a connection, and Casey and I grabbed the last available seats, which were in an exit row with no window. Our new flight path was over the Alps, and I didn’t know about the wind tunnels until the plane started rocking and leaning so far to one side I thought we were going to tip over. I’m a pretty experienced flier, but I had never felt so much jeopardy. I was clinging to my kids’ pictures and crying, and even Casey was nervous. I sobbed to him that we were going to die. After everything I’d been experiencing, was this the way my story would end? Of course, that’s not what happened, and when we emerged shaking from the plane and hugged our friends, nothing else seemed as important as just being there alive. Oh, and downing a double vodka!

When life throws you a curve that’s beyond your control, it’s time to focus like a laser beam on those things you can control. My last year has been emotionally dizzying. Every day I wake up and feel a different emotion. For me, one way of taking control is to focus on what makes me feel good about myself — what improves my wellbeing. For example, I started Pilates, and I loved the challenge that took me out of my head and gave me such a sense of accomplishment. And I went zip lining — maybe the scariest thing I’ve ever done, but I felt elated when it was over. It’s not a novel thought, but it’s absolutely true that when you take care of your health and energy, and take some physical risks, the rest follows.

I’ve also found it so rewarding to have a little more time with my kids. That includes moments that a mom remembers forever. Walking into school to do some business a week before school started, I said to Christian, “Hold my hand just right now, because I know you’re not going to let me when I actually bring you to school next week. Just hold Mommy’s hand for ten seconds when we’re walking into school.” He looked at me and got this shit eating grin, and then took my hand. Afterward, when we went to get his hair cut we were walking up the stairs to the barber and I said, “Let’s do it again. Just hold Mommy’s hand for ten seconds before we get to the top.”"

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/starr082298.htm,Washingtonpost.com Special Report: Clinton Accused,[],,"Clinton at White House Monday before his public statement. (AP) 

 

 President Clinton testified this week that he gave Monica S. Lewinsky several gifts during a weekend meeting at the White House shortly after Christmas, the last time they were together before their secret affair triggered a criminal investigation, sources familiar with his account said yesterday. Clinton and Lewinsky met on Dec. 28, nine days after she had been served with a subpoena demanding her testimony about their sexual relationship and just before she was offered a job in New York arranged by presidential friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr. Clinton testified that he gave her a throw rug, a pin and an Alaskan stone carving as farewell presents, the sources said. The meeting has become a central focus of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation into whether Clinton committed perjury or obstruction of justice in the Paula Jones civil lawsuit. The president's lawyers believe that his presents to Lewinsky that day demonstrate that he did not instruct her to return other gifts to his secretary rather than comply with the Jones subpoena for them, the sources said. Further details about Clinton's testimony emerged on the same day that the president's legal defense fund announced it has raised $2.2 million in the last six months, more than was collected during the previous four years of his presidency combined. The newly reconstituted defense fund, operating with looser rules about who can give and how much they can offer, tapped into resentment against Starr as more than 17,000 Clinton supporters sent money. Hollywood was quick to come to the president's aid. Among the 62 donors giving the maximum $10,000 were performers and directors such as Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand, Michael Douglas, Ron Howard, Norman Lear, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw-Spielberg as well as studio executives Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Harvey Weinstein and Bud Yorkin. ""We believe that no first family should face such a horrendous financial burden while trying to carry out the work which the American people elected him to do,"" said David Pryor, the former Democratic senator and Clinton friend from Arkansas who founded the legal fund. On another front of the multi-faceted legal fight, the White House filed a petition yesterday asking the Supreme Court to prevent Starr from questioning the president's closest aide, deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey. Two lower courts have ruled that Clinton cannot invoke attorney-client privilege to prevent White House lawyers from testifying in Starr's criminal investigation, but the White House said in its petition yesterday that those decisions already have had ""a dramatic effect on his ability to seek the candid and forthright advice he needs,"" including about how to defend himself against possible impeachment. The issue of gifts and how they were handled has developed into one of the most critical in the Starr investigation, and testimony from Clinton and Lewinsky conflicts on that point, sources familiar with the situation said. Lewinsky was summoned back to the grand jury Thursday three days after the president testified via closed-circuit television from the White House. The Jones subpoena served on Lewinsky on Dec. 19 ordered her to hand over ""each and every gift including, but not limited to, any and all dresses, accessories, and jewelry, and/or hat pins given to you by, or on behalf of, Defendant Clinton."" Tipped off by onetime Lewinsky friend Linda R. Tripp, the Jones lawyers knew the president had given her a T-shirt or dress and a book of poetry. Clinton testified Monday that they discussed what to do about the gifts and that he told her she had to turn over what she had in her possession, sources have said. Lewinsky reportedly heard it differently, understanding him to say that she did not have to turn over any gifts that were no longer in her possession. Shortly after their meeting, the president's personal secretary, Betty Currie, contacted Lewinsky saying she understood the former White House intern had something to give her. According to one account, Currie went over to Lewinsky's Watergate apartment personally to collect the gifts, which she kept until Starr's investigation began and she turned them over to prosecutors. Because Lewinsky said she did not initiate her contact with Currie about the gifts, prosecutors are examining whether Clinton directed Currie to retrieve them. Clinton denied doing so during his testimony, sources have said. Currie's version remains undisclosed, although sources close to the case have said it conflicts with Clinton's on certain points. Lewinsky went to see Clinton on Dec. 28 just as she was considering how to answer questions about their affair under oath in the Jones case. They had long ago agreed to keep their relationship secret and, although Lewinsky has testified that Clinton did not directly ask her to lie in the lawsuit, on Jan. 7 she signed an affidavit denying the affair. By giving her the throw rug, pin and carving in their holiday meeting, Clinton showed that he was unaware of the return of any other gifts, allies argued yesterday. The president testified he did not know Currie had collected gifts from Lewinsky until the early days of the Starr investigation. ""The moral of the story is, if he was orchestrating an obstruction campaign, why was he giving her gifts on the 28th?"" asked a Clinton ally informed about the situation. ""It doesn't make any sense and it bolsters the idea that he learned of the handling of the gifts when the story became public."" But it could also undermine Clinton's own testimony in the Jones case. During his Jan. 17 deposition, just three weeks after his meeting with Lewinsky, Clinton was asked,""Have you ever given any gifts to Monica Lewinsky?"" He answered, ""I don't recall. Do you know what they were?"" Clinton later conceded that he ""could have given her a gift, but I don't remember a specific gift."" Under questioning, he said he bought souvenir items from the Black Dog store in Martha's Vineyard that were given to Lewinsky by Currie. He was also asked if he was ever alone in the Oval Office with Lewinsky and said ""I don't recall,"" although he allowed that she may have come to drop off papers for him while she still worked there. Her White House employment, however, ended in April 1996. Sources have said the Dec. 28 meeting occurred in the Oval Office and they were alone for a time. Clinton offered a different version during the Jones deposition, testifying that Lewinsky dropped by the White House ""to see Betty before Christmas"" and he ""stuck my head out [and] said hello to her."" As he tries to defend himself in Starr's investigation, Clinton has less to worry about in terms of his finances. With the creation of a new legal defense fund by Pryor in February, he is collecting a considerable share of his expenses, which totaled $6.5 million by the end of April, not including more than $1 million of costs related to the Jones case that were paid by insurance companies. Trustees for the new fund reported that they have paid $1.25 million to Williams & Connolly, the firm handling Clinton's defense in the Whitewater, Lewinsky and other investigations, and expect to make another payment next month. The new trust fund was established in February less than two months after the Clintons closed down their old legal defense organization because it had become too mired in its own legal problems and too constrained by restrictions on fund-raising. Because technically it was set up independent of the Clintons, the new fund can accept donations as large as $10,000 instead of just $1,000 and it can directly solicit money. Contributions are prohibited from noncitizens, executive branch employees, registered lobbyists, labor unions, corporations and political action committees. Run by attorney Anthony F. Essaye, the new fund has also been helped by the active involvement of fund-raisers Terence McAuliffe, Beth Dozoretz and Cynthia Yorkin; McAuliffe masterminded Clinton's reelection finances in 1996. A direct-mail solicitation signed by Pryor was sent to 170,000 people culled from Clinton-Gore and other Democratic fund-raising lists and drew nearly a 10 percent response rate. Thomasina Canty, a retired schoolteacher from Lansing, Mich., said she gave $100 because she was convinced that Clinton has been targeted by his political enemies. ""He was a marked man ever since he got there,"" she said. His Monday admission that he had an affair with Lewinsky left her unfazed; she sent another $100 after the speech. Thomas B. Schueck, a steel company chief executive from Little Rock, said his $1,000 contribution was ""very much an anti-Starr"" message and he too was undaunted by Clinton's turnabout this week. ""It's not the kind of thing any man is proud of,"" Schueck said, ""but we're all human."""

Many people who read the piece felt that it amounted to victim blaming, and that Bialik was unforgivably asking potential targets of sexual assault to be responsible for curbing the behavior of predatory men. But the more widespread backlash was reserved for Bialik’s suggestion that only pretty women experience harassment and assault.

In particular, numerous actresses spoke out, with many saying that their own experiences with sexual assault didn’t align with what Bialik was arguing.

Bialik’s own experience also didn’t align with those of the thousands of survivors who trended the #MeToo hashtag in response.

Words of support and empowerment were also widespread.

There were also calls for men to do more to combat harassment, instead of relying on women to do so by sharing their stories:

Twitter’s ongoing role in the discussion wasn’t forgotten either:

Bialik responded to the backlash Sunday night, tweeting that her words had been taken out of context.

There was, however, at least one chilling reminder that the “too ugly to be raped” myth is alive and well:

“I didn’t really think that they were going to have affairs with Harvey, quite honestly, and clearly they didn’t. But the idea that this predator, this assaulter, was out there silencing women like that…it’s beyond infuriating, and the fact that the story is coming out now, and the more that comes out, I want to know all of it,” Clooney added.

Clooney was accused of blacklisting Vanessa Marquez — with whom he worked on the television series ER –after she complained of racial and sexual harassment. Clooney denied the accusations.

“I knew he was a womanizer. I wouldn’t want to be married to the guy, but that’s not my business really,” he added. “But this level of criminal sexual predation is not something that I ever thought was going on — absolutely not.”

Katherine Pope, head of TV division at Studio 8 slammed her industry’s favoritism toward machismo and male directors.

“The industry values male characteristics,” said Gregory. “When a female director comes in who is more searching in her response to things, we as an industry say they don’t know what they’re doing. Where’s the ego, where’s the drive? We have overvalued certain male characteristics of ego, drive, certainty. It makes for quite bland drama.”

“For the record, I will not be going on a talk show to disclose names of my abusers or anyone else’s abusers. So please stop asking me to do so,” Feldman wrote. “The practice of sensationalizing this topic with no plan of action or protection for my family would prove fruitless. I have been through enough!”

“This is not about fear of being sued!” he later tweeted. “Yes, that’s a real possibility. But the bigger reason is safety for my family.

[I’m] already over this,” said Feldman, who has been sounding the alarm about pedophilia in Hollywood for years. “My career was shut down, I have been mocked and shamed for doing what I have done to this point!

“I knew enough to do more than I did,” Tarantino said. “There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip. It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.”

What are you going to do for me?’” the One Tree Hill star told Yahoo Style Friday. “And I remember in that moment being like, ‘Oh, my God! I am going to have to sleep with this man in order to fulfill my dreams.’ I ended up just bawling, crying, and having a panic attack, and he left.”

“I’ll never forget that, how easy it is for something like that to happen and for me to think ‘I can’t do this,’ and then they win,” the singer said.

Before our very eyes you can see the issue of sexual assault becoming a chic trend, a bandwagon to get your name in the trades. But nothing is being done to punish the bad guys.

In a New Yorker article titled “All the Other Harvey’s,” the Riverdale star addressed an explicit comment Jeffrey Katzenberg was quoted as saying in a Movieline article in 1995.

“The head of a major studio — and, incidentally, someone who claims himself to be horrified by the Harvey allegations—was quoted as saying, ‘I wouldn’t know [Molly Ringwald] if she sat on my face.’ Maybe he was misquoted. If he ever sent a note of apology, it must have gotten lost in the mail.”

Katzenberg extended an apology to Ringwald Tuesday, saying “That Molly Ringwald had to read those words attributed to me and believe I said them is horrifying, mortifying and embarrassing to me.”

Ringwald recounts how when she “was thirteen, a fifty-year-old crew member told me that he would teach me to dance, and then proceeded to push against me with an erection. When I was fourteen, a married film director stuck his tongue in my mouth on set.”

The actress said she was “lucky” that she was never “cajoled into a taxi, nor did I have to turn down giving or getting a massage” while filming the Weinstein-backed 1990 movie Strike It Rich.

Update – 4:00 p.m.: Actress Jessica Chastain scorched her industry speaking at the At Elle Magazine’s Women In Entertainment event on Monday evening, calling Hollywood an “industry rife with racism, sexism and homophobia.”

“It is so closely woven into the fabric of the business that we have become snowblind to the glaring injustices happening everyday,” she said.

The actress added: “Oh we’re very quick to point the finger at others and address the issue with social action and fundraising. Yet there is a clear disconnect between how we practice what we preach in our industry.” Chastain pointed specifically to actors and actresses who have been told to stay closeted while the industry champions same-sex marriage, as well as the wage gap that exists between the sexes even as the industry itself supports equal pay legislation.”

I mean, what am I gonna do? I can’t step up, certainly then, on allegations,” Ulrich told Cosmopolitan.

Update – 1:45 p.m.: Game of Thrones star Lena Headey revealed Tuesday that she had a series of disturbing encounters with Weinstein, one of which brought her to tears.

Weinstein “said, let’s go up to my room, I want to give you a script,” Headey wrote on Twitter. “We walked to the lift and the energy shifted, my whole body went into high alert, the lift was going up and I said to Harvey, I’m not interested in anything other than work. He was silent as I spoke, furious.”

Headey said she felt “completely powerless” as Weinstein “marched” her toward his room. After realizing that his room key didn’t work, he walked the actress back to the elevator.

Update – 10:45 a.m.: Jeffery Katzenberg — who was chairman of Walt Disney Studios from 1984 to 1994 and was later a co-founder and CEO of DreamWorks Animation — said Hollywood sex predators are “a pack of wolves” and said Harvey Weinstein “didn’t act alone.”

“The casting couch has been in Hollywood from the beginning,” Katzenberg said Monday at the WSJD tech conference. “The complicity around the acceptance of it and silence about it is the crime. Harvey Weinstein, make no mistake about it, he is a monster.”

“The problem is there’s a pack of wolves. He’s not a lone actor in this,” Katzenberg said of Weinstein. “I’ve had hundreds of meetings with Harvey Weinstein, and literally not a single time was Harvey abusive to someone in my presence. Somehow this behavior was masked by him.”

Update – 10:30 a.m.: An unnamed Oscar-winning actor has become embroiled in the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal. The Hollywood A-lister was accused by a top US broadcaster of assaulting a loved one, who she has not publicly revealed, and cannot for legal reasons.

“We knew about the man’s hunger; his fervor; his appetite,” Rosenberg wrote. “There was nothing secret about this voracious rapacity; like a gluttonous ogre out of the Brothers Grimm. All couched in vague promises of potential movie roles.”

Among those who knew and discussed Weinstein’s behavior, according to Rosenberg, were “the big producers; you, the big directors; you, the big agents; you, the big financiers. And you, the big rival studio chiefs; you, the big actors; you, the big actresses; you, the big models. You, the big journalists; you, the big screenwriters; you, the big rock stars; you, the big restaurateurs; you, the big politicians.”

We are stood side-by-side with only tape on covering our privates.

While never naming the film director who she says harassed her, the actress said: “when i turned the director down repeatedly he sulked and punished me and created for his team an impressive net of illusion where i was framed as the difficult one.”

Allen has denied any wrongdoing. Connecticut authorities never charged the filmmaker with a crime.

Allen — who has worked with Weinstein on several projects, including the Oscar-winning Mighty Aphrodite — said he hopes this scandal doesn’t “lead to a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself.

He tried to trick me into thinking his genitals were actually his face. It almost worked. The resemblance is uncanny.”

Weinstein was roasted during the “Weekend Update” segment, which featured co-anchor Colin Jost searing the filmmaker after introducing the new Apple iOS emojis.

“Apple has announced that it will add hundreds of new emojis to its iOS system, including a person at a spa, a vomiting face and a shushing finger — finally giving emoji fans the ability to describe what it was like to work for Harvey Weinstein,” Jost joked.

He later said: “Weinstein, who has been accused of multiple counts of sexual assault, is reportedly going to Europe for sex rehab. Somehow I don’t think that’s really going to help anybody. He doesn’t need sex rehab. He needs a specialized facility where there are no women, no contact with the outside world, metal bars and it’s a prison.”

Trump touched her inappropriately.”

The subpoena — whose contents have not been previously reported — was issued in March but entered into the court file last month. The White House did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Trump’s attorney.

Summer Zervos, a former contestant on the Trump’s reality TV show The Apprentice, accused Trump of kissing and grabbing her when she went to his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007 to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization. After Zervos made the accusation last October, just weeks before the election, Trump denied her accusation and called it a lie.

She responded by suing him for defamation. As part of that suit, her lawyers served a subpoena on his campaign, asking that it preserve all documents it had about her."
http://bit.ly/2dHI1Ml,"Fact-Check: Yes, Bill Clinton Was Disbarred and Fined After Impeachment",['John Hayward'],9 Oct 2016,"During the second presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said that Bill Clinton was impeached, disbarred, and fined as a result of the Lewinsky scandal.

Bill Clinton was indeed impeached for lying under oath to a grand jury and obstructing justice, although he was not removed from office.

After impeachment, Bill Clinton was held in contempt of court by federal Judge Susan Webber Wright, in what the New York Times described as a “scathing” ruling. Wright said Clinton testified falsely in his deposition about not having sex with Monica Lewinsky, and that his actions “subverted the rule of law and violated Ms. Jones’s right to information relevant to her case.”

“The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation’s President in contempt of court,” Wright wrote. However, she added, “the record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiffs’ questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process.”

Clinton’s law license in Arkansas was suspended for five years, and he paid a $25,000 fine. The Supreme Court also barred Clinton from practicing law before the nation’s highest court.

Trump made a reference to an $850,000 fine Bill Clinton paid to Paula Jones. This was, in fact, an out-of-court settlement Clinton reached with Jones, not a fine leveled by the court.

The purpose of reaching an out-of-court settlement is to avoid an unpleasant trial that could very well end with even worse consequences, so Trump is basically correct that Clinton’s conduct cost him $850,000, and he didn’t want to pay it – it most certainly was not a charitable contribution! – but it technically wasn’t a “fine.”"

The movement, which caused #MeToo to trend nationwide on Twitter Sunday night, apparently gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano sent a call to action to her more than 3 million Twitter followers.

People across the globe are standing up against sexual harassment and assault by posting the phrase “me too” on Facebook and Twitter in an effort to show how widespread the problem has become.

As of Sunday at 9 p.m., Milano’s post had more than 14,000 replies, 8,000 likes, and 4,400 retweets.

The post also prompted several other celebrities, including actresses Anna Paquin and Debra Messing, to come forward.

The posts come after The New York Times published an investigative report earlier this month detailing decades of sexual harassment allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein. (Among those who have come forward include actresses Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie.) Following the initial Times report, an article was published by The New Yorker in which 13 women accused Weinstein of sexually harassing or assaulting them since the 1990s.

Wire material from The New York Times was used in this report."

Mayes, 43, will be sentenced Dec. 18 by Montgomery County Common Pleas Judge Steven K. Dankof.
• One count of forcible rape of a child under the age of 13, a charge that carries a mandatory life sentence under Ohio law.
• Eleven counts of rape of a child under 13.
• Eight counts of gross sexual imposition of a child under 13.
• Two counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.
• One count of dissemination of matter harmful to juveniles.

Under the life sentence, Mayes would be eligible for parole in 10 years. However, he could face more prison time for the 24 other counts.

The alleged offenses in Mayes’ three indictments cover more than 14 years. Mayes was arrested in May 2011.

The case started when a juvenile victim went to Huber Heights police in 2009. That investigation led police to other victims who live in other jurisdictions, police said in 2011.

http://dlvr.it/PvyXXs,Opinion | Why I thought twice before saying #MeToo,[],2017-10-16T18:01:18Z,"The impulse behind the #MeToo hashtag is the same one that animates so many of our bitterest debates today. Those of us who know for sure that sexual harassment is real because we’ve experienced it are trying to convince others who have been lucky enough not to have the same experiences that those experiences are, in fact, real. This can be a crazy-making conversation. When someone insists that you haven’t, in fact, lived through what you’ve lived through, it’s easy to vacillate between rage at that person’s denial and destabilizing doubt. But it’s also an essential conversation: Unless a lot of us can agree on the basic fact that widespread sexual harassment exists, we’re going to have trouble moving on to the next, vital phase — which involves figuring out what to do about it.

And that’s where things get really difficult. Consciousness-raising moments such as #MeToo, or previous hashtags such as #YesAllWomen or #WhatWereYouWearing; or Anita Hill’s 1991 testimony before Congress about the sexual harassment she said Clarence Thomas subjected her to; or the 1971 “Rape Speak Out” organized by the New York Radical Feminists, are opening salvos in the fights against sexual harassment and sexual violence. But they are entirely insufficient to end these problems on their own.

Moments of new awareness have often led to genuine improvements in law and culture. Two 1979 court cases helped advance the movement to treat marital rape as a crime, rather than as an assertion of a man’s ownership of his wife. Hill’s testimony encouraged sexual harassment victims to file complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and helped dissolve opposition, including from the White House, to a bill that helped those victims pursue damages, back pay and reinstatement to their jobs if they had been terminated. Time and time again, brave women have opened the necessary space for change, and time and time again, those around them have made some progress. They just haven’t made nearly enough.

Now, the moment created by the alleged depredations of Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly and even Donald Trump raises the question of what we will do in this generation. Will lawmakers crack down on the practice of forcing employees who come forward with sexual harassment allegations into confidential arbitration proceedings, rather than letting them seek jury trials for their claims, as Ailes tried to do after Gretchen Carlson accused him of harassment? What about the confidential financial settlements that Weinstein used to silence accusers? These provisions are intended to prevent companies from the grievous exposure that the Weinstein Co. is currently experiencing. But they also deny the public a close look at the rot that eats away at organizations that tolerate this kind of behavior.

More narrowly, will the entertainment industry end the practice of conducting meetings in hotel suites? Will Weinstein be just the first person expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his conduct, the beginning of an industry-wide house-cleaning? Or will he also be the last, his downfall a fig leaf for larger inaction? What can Hollywood do to assure that no producers, directors or studio heads become so powerful that their desire to prey on the most vulnerable players in the business is tolerated as the cost of doing business?

And as daunting as these challenges are, they don’t even get to the deeper questions: How does someone like Weinstein convince himself that this is normal, that this is fine, that “I’m used to that” and therefore this must be all right? At what point do people decide that they can just take what they want? And how can we possibly stop them before they get there?

I don’t know the answers to these questions or the outcome of these legislative fights. But I do know that for #MeToo to be worth it, the result can’t just be that we make ourselves feel bad by revisiting painful memories and hearing stories that reveal the depth of our own denial. All this pain needs to turn into concrete action, or we’ll be back here again in 20 or 30 years — and the stories we tell then may be even worse."

http://dlvr.it/Pw32Dv,"Iraq, Catalonia, #MeToo: Your Tuesday Briefing",['Patrick Boehler'],2017-10-17T04:03:07.000Z,"130 million years ago, while dinosaurs still walked the Earth, a pair of dead stars collided. The explosion rattled spacetime and sent waves of light across the universe. On August 17, 2017, light from that explosion appeared as a bright pinprick in the galaxy NGC 4993, then faded to a glowing red ember. Ripples of traumatized spacetime from the distant explosion squeezed and stretched the L-shaped arms of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Converted to sound waves, the ripples produced a faint rising chirp. Two seconds later, NASA’s Fermi space telescope detected a gamma ray burst. A brief glint of high-energy radiation from one of the most violent events in nature. Astronomers raced to point their telescopes before the precious light faded away. First on the scene was the Swope telescope in Chile. Right on its heels was the nearby Dark Energy Camera. The antennas of the Very Large Array strained to record radio emissions from the fireball. Even the Hubble space telescope turned its peerless mirror toward NGC 4993. Within hours, the distant explosion had become one of the most observed events in recent astronomical history. Astronomers think the story began with a pair of massive stars that were orbiting each other. The larger star ran out of fuel and collapsed into a dense neutron star. Neutron stars are the densest visible objects in the universe, spinning dervishes bristling with powerful magnetic fields. A teaspoonful of this starstuff would weigh as much as Mount Everest. The intense gravity of the neutron star began to steal gas from its aging sister star. The swirl of hot gas dragged the two stars together until the neutron star began orbiting inside its sister, shredding its outer layers into a swirling cloud of elements. But the sister star survived this mutilation, and eventually exploded, too. Collapsing into a second neutron star. The fuse was now lit for one final cataclysm. Twin spheres of incredible density were now locked in an ever tightening dance of doom. Shedding energy in the form of gravitational waves, the two neutron stars spiralled closer and closer, faster and faster. And finally merged in a moment of astrophysical ecstasy. A kilonova explosion. A crucible for cosmic alchemy. The swirling cloud of superheated atoms was bombarded with neutrons, forging new atoms of gold and platinum and other heavy elements. Scientists think most of the precious metals in the universe were created in kilonova explosions like these. When black holes collide there is nothing to see, though LIGO can hear the chirp from their gravitational waves. But neutron stars are visible matter, and collide within a glowing cloud. This was the first gravitational-wave catastrophe that astronomers saw as well as heard. Our first glimpse of the mysterious physics inside neutron stars. And a first fleeting glimpse of a cosmic mint in the sky."

She is also friends with Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman, and wrote in a blog post that she was sickened by the “disturbing” sexual abuse allegations against him.

Women listened. Within hours, tweets with the words “me too” began appearing in droves. By 4 a.m. Monday, more than 200,000 #metoo tweets were published by Twitter’s count. The stories came pouring forth on Facebook as well with nearly 80,000 people said to be “talking about this” by the wee hours Monday.

The messages were striking in their simplicity, and in the sheer number of them. Those two words soon became a hashtag, the top trend nationwide on Twitter and yet another rallying cry for women — and men — who have experienced some type of sexual harassment or assault.

Many shared brief but painful personal stories of their experiences, some reaching back to their teen years, others to bad memories of abuse in the workplace never revealed, of troubles they encountered in their families and of their own silence in the face of harassment or assault.

“I have been raped twice in my life,” tweeted one woman, “stalked four times and was threatened with my life when I tried to speak out @ 14.”

There was the woman who said she was assaulted by a man who pretended to work at a local YMCA, and the woman who said she was groped in an elevator by a superior who was nearly two decades older. “I never told anyone,” she said.

Another recounted how in the sixth grade, a group of boys held her up against a wall as they pulled up her shirt to “see if I stuffed my bra with Charmin or Bounty.”

A number of men shared their stories as well, including one who said he was raped by two men in high school and has never gotten over it.

On Oct. 5, the day the New York Times expose revealed the claims against Weinstein, thousands of people took to Twitter to share their own encounters with sexual harassment in the workplace, using the hashtag #MyHarveyWeinstein.

Each time this has happened, predatory behavior once held in secrecy, and still tolerated in many settings, has become a little more public. Victims who may have suffered in silence seem to feel liberated, knowing they’re not alone.

Some women and victims of sexual assault expressed that Sunday’s stream of tweets felt empowering. For others, the sheer volume of posts — the pervasiveness of the issue — was disturbing. As Natalie Gouché wrote on Facebook:

As I read all of the #Me Too posts out there I feel heartbroken. So many women have been sexually assaulted. And many in their youth. As I think to myself “it’s never happened to me.” I realize that while I’ve not been sexually assaulted I have been sexually harassed (many times before.) Sadly that’s the case with most women at some point in their lives right? . . . Seeing so many women vocalize that they have been sexually assaulted or harassed gives more women the courage and bravery to speak up, tell someone, and not feel so ashamed.

“It is because of my love” for Weinstein’s wife and children “that I haven’t publicly commented on this until now,” Milano wrote. “Please don’t confuse my silence for anything other than respect for a dear friend and her beautiful children.”

“This is not an uncommon occurrence,” she added. “This is a sick culture. Men like Harvey Weinstein are around every corner. Men who undermine women and their strength, ability and intelligence exist everywhere.”"
http://ift.tt/2ysHDvZ,"Iraq, Catalonia, #MeToo: Your Tuesday Briefing",['Patrick Boehler'],2017-10-17T04:03:07.000Z,"130 million years ago, while dinosaurs still walked the Earth, a pair of dead stars collided. The explosion rattled spacetime and sent waves of light across the universe. On August 17, 2017, light from that explosion appeared as a bright pinprick in the galaxy NGC 4993, then faded to a glowing red ember. Ripples of traumatized spacetime from the distant explosion squeezed and stretched the L-shaped arms of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Converted to sound waves, the ripples produced a faint rising chirp. Two seconds later, NASA’s Fermi space telescope detected a gamma ray burst. A brief glint of high-energy radiation from one of the most violent events in nature. Astronomers raced to point their telescopes before the precious light faded away. First on the scene was the Swope telescope in Chile. Right on its heels was the nearby Dark Energy Camera. The antennas of the Very Large Array strained to record radio emissions from the fireball. Even the Hubble space telescope turned its peerless mirror toward NGC 4993. Within hours, the distant explosion had become one of the most observed events in recent astronomical history. Astronomers think the story began with a pair of massive stars that were orbiting each other. The larger star ran out of fuel and collapsed into a dense neutron star. Neutron stars are the densest visible objects in the universe, spinning dervishes bristling with powerful magnetic fields. A teaspoonful of this starstuff would weigh as much as Mount Everest. The intense gravity of the neutron star began to steal gas from its aging sister star. The swirl of hot gas dragged the two stars together until the neutron star began orbiting inside its sister, shredding its outer layers into a swirling cloud of elements. But the sister star survived this mutilation, and eventually exploded, too. Collapsing into a second neutron star. The fuse was now lit for one final cataclysm. Twin spheres of incredible density were now locked in an ever tightening dance of doom. Shedding energy in the form of gravitational waves, the two neutron stars spiralled closer and closer, faster and faster. And finally merged in a moment of astrophysical ecstasy. A kilonova explosion. A crucible for cosmic alchemy. The swirling cloud of superheated atoms was bombarded with neutrons, forging new atoms of gold and platinum and other heavy elements. Scientists think most of the precious metals in the universe were created in kilonova explosions like these. When black holes collide there is nothing to see, though LIGO can hear the chirp from their gravitational waves. But neutron stars are visible matter, and collide within a glowing cloud. This was the first gravitational-wave catastrophe that astronomers saw as well as heard. Our first glimpse of the mysterious physics inside neutron stars. And a first fleeting glimpse of a cosmic mint in the sky."

http://dlvr.it/PvxgnF,#MeToo: survivors testify to the impossibility of preempting sexual assault,['Aja Romano'],2017-10-16T12:30:02-04:00,"Widespread outrage over the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations continued to play out on social media over the weekend — this time through #MeToo, a powerful hashtag aimed at illustrating that anyone can be a victim of sexual harassment.

The hashtag was spurred primarily by an opinion piece in the New York Times, “Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein's World,” which was written by The Big Bang Theory’s Mayim Bialik and quickly went viral. Bialik argued that women are essentially harassed on a hierarchical tier based on how attractive they are and how they dress.

The argument was an affront to many readers, who rushed to point out that in reality, women of all types are harassed. As discussion of Bialik’s op-ed continued, actress Alyssa Milano suggested that women reply “me too” to a single tweet:

This isn’t the first time the idea of testifying to sexual assault through the framing of a “me too” has gained traction. An earlier ""Me Too"" movement was started over a decade ago by black feminist Tarana Burke, to empower other black women and girls who are sexual assault survivors.

Milano wasn’t aware of that background until Vox reached her for comment Monday evening, whereupon she tweeted noting the movement’s origin story, which she described as “heartbreaking and inspiring.”

But the idea resonated with many women and other survivors, who responded to Milano’s original tweet and passed it on.

The idea spread rapidly, as women began speaking about their experiences with sexual harassment and assault on both Twitter and Facebook, and the #MeToo hashtag was born.

In her op-ed, Bialik painted herself as being savvy enough to preemptively ward off sexual assault

Bialik’s op-ed piece in the Times was framed as an account of her personal experience with rigorous beauty standards in Hollywood relative to the Weinstein scandal. Her argument was two-pronged: She suggested that Hollywood’s emphasis on extreme beauty has insulated her from the worst forms of harassment throughout her career, and she described the acts of “self-protection” — including dressing down and modifying her behavior — that have helped her ward off unwanted attention from men.

“As a proud feminist with little desire to diet, get plastic surgery or hire a personal trainer, I have almost no personal experience with men asking me to meetings in their hotel rooms,” she wrote. “Those of us in Hollywood who don’t represent an impossible standard of beauty have the ‘luxury’ of being overlooked and, in many cases, ignored by men in power unless we can make them money.”

While Bialik acknowledged that “Nothing — absolutely nothing — excuses men for assaulting or abusing women,” she went on to declare that women “can’t be naïve about the culture we live in,” explaining that she makes “choices” she deems “self-protecting and wise.”

“I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with,” she wrote. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.”

Many people who read the piece felt that it amounted to victim blaming, and that Bialik was unforgivably asking potential targets of sexual assault to be responsible for curbing the behavior of predatory men. But the more widespread backlash was reserved for Bialik’s suggestion that only pretty women experience harassment and assault.

In particular, numerous actresses spoke out, with many saying that their own experiences with sexual assault didn’t align with what Bialik was arguing.

Bialik’s own experience also didn’t align with those of the thousands of survivors who trended the #MeToo hashtag in response.

Words of support and empowerment were also widespread.

There were also calls for men to do more to combat harassment, instead of relying on women to do so by sharing their stories:

Twitter’s ongoing role in the discussion wasn’t forgotten either:

Bialik responded to the backlash Sunday night, tweeting that her words had been taken out of context.

There was, however, at least one chilling reminder that the “too ugly to be raped” myth is alive and well:

Update: This story has been updated to include the historical context of the “me too” movement started by Tarana Burke over a decade ago."

Not anywhere, and certainly not in Hollywood. Treating women like disposable commodities is an age-old practice that transcends any one industry but is particularly endemic in those where a few gatekeepers decide who works and who doesn't, often based on their own subjective tastes. The only thing novel about Weinstein's behavior, aside from its scale, is how many people now agree it was wrong.

What has changed is the language we have available to talk about abuses of power, including but not limited to rape. For years, what powerful men did in Hollywood, politics or elsewhere in pop culture was described in terms of ""seduction ,"" "" sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll "" and ""free love,"" and it took on a sordid glamour. These men were ""womanizers "" and ""libertines."" Even now, if you listen to famous people say what ""everybody knew"" about Weinstein, it's often couched in language like George Clooney used this past week: ""If you're asking if I knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young, beautiful women, sure."" Weinstein hid in plain sight because there was nothing remarkable about a man trying to trade his power for sex with an otherwise unwilling woman. What else are young and beautiful women for?

Thanks in part to the feminist movement, some of these stories are now being retold from the perspective of those women, using such words as ""rape"" (not just as a property crime, and not just involving physical force) and ""assault"" and, most of all, ""abuse of power."" Such a necessary reframing lends the speaker some of the power long denied to victims, but it also opens new horizons with unclear boundaries for men and women. Much of the behavior described by the women who spoke to the New Yorker about Weinstein's abuse is, by their accounts, criminal; they said no, they tried to get away. But beyond yes and no, power dynamics are harder to parse. Abuses of power range across all kinds of conduct, with all kinds of frequency. They take place at work and in the bedroom, and not all are illegal. In my own field, the media, there are subtweets and group texts in which women discuss wrongdoers; there was briefly even a spreadsheet listing men to stay away from, only a few of whom were accused of Weinsteinesque actions.

There is a basic social consensus, at least on paper if not always in practice, that sex should not be forced and bosses should not proposition subordinates. But between those unambiguous wrongs and some fantastical utopia of enthusiastic consent is a world of ambiguity, where we don't yet know how to spot, taxonomize and, if necessary, punish acts that involve technical consent but feel like violation. A lens as broad as ""abuse of power"" means it's hard to know what counts.

As much as this feels like uncharted territory, for feminism this is a return to form. As activists set about transforming law and culture in the 1960s, they boldly invited public sanction into what had been considered the private domain. They argued that sexual violators weren't just mythical strangers in the streets; they included husbands, upstanding men, and even do-gooders in the antiwar and civil rights movements, whose sexism inspired what we now call the Second Wave. When Weinstein invoked the '60s and '70s to excuse his behavior (""that was the culture then""), he was partly right, at least as far as the law went. Raping your spouse wasn't a crime; a court first accepted it as such in 1979. The Supreme Court didn't recognize sexual harassment as a violation of federal employment law until 1986, and the concept still seemed foreign to many Americans when Anita Hill bravely took the stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991. (For all the talk of accusations ruining lives, Clarence Thomas still sits on the Supreme Court.) It took until 2012 for the FBI to update its definition of rape from ""the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will"" to any type of penetration ""without the consent of the victim.""

But a bitter split among feminists over pornography and sex work in the '80s and '90s shattered the consensus on what, exactly, constituted coercive or problematic sexual behavior and what was the exercise of sexual agency. And feminists, perhaps, were sick of being called anti-sex. So the affair that President Bill Clinton — the first Democratic president after the Reagan backlash — carried on with a young subordinate did not prompt the movement's finest hour. Of Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, Gloria Steinem wrote in a New York Times op-ed, ""The power imbalance between them increased the index of suspicion, but there is no evidence to suggest that Ms. Lewinsky's will was violated; quite the contrary."" Lewinsky herself wrote in 2014, ""Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship.""

These days, though, you hear less of the term ""sex positive,"" bandied about proudly into the new millennium. It now implicitly requires a follow-up: Sex on whose terms? Positive for whom? Listening to the accounts of heterosexual women working and dating today, the older feminist critiques of male power and the sexual revolution seem as relevant as ever. In a 1982 essay, ""Toward a Feminist Sexual Revolution ,"" feminist critic Ellen Willis observed that the supposed sexual liberation movement of Hugh Hefner was actually a ""sexual libertarian movement,"" and that ""liberation involves not only the abolition of restrictions but the positive presence of social and psychological conditions that foster satisfying sexual relations."" Thirty-five years later, the British feminist Laurie Penney wrote, in an essay that predated the Weinstein revelations, ""Today's sexual freedom is rather like today's market freedom, in that what it practically entails is freedom for people with power to dictate terms and freedom for everyone else to shut up and smile."" Less had changed than advocates once hoped, or perhaps than young women once assumed.

So what behavior should land a man on a list of bad actors in a world still largely controlled by men? What about the guy who has a consensual relationship with a woman who works for him? Or the man who perennially humiliates his partner by staying too late at the party and talking too close? Or the one who is always sending borderline private messages and setting up nebulously professional meetings that seem poised to turn sexual? Or, to use examples from the Weinstein episode, the man who employs a subtler version of Weinstein's badgering that was captured on tape (""Don't embarrass me. . . . Don't ruin your friendship with me for five minutes"")? Or the one who, after ignoring a firm no, might eventually get a resigned yes?

What constitutes coercion when women are less likely to have the resources or social power of their male peers, when we are still conditioned to placate them and measure ourselves by their attention? Even encounters that do not involve the commission of a crime or the violation of employment law can do their damage, suggesting consent alone is an incomplete standard. What these stories have in common is what Penney calls ""the ubiquitous, unspoken understanding that women are first and foremost objects of desire, not individuals with desires — sexual, professional — of their own.""

Hence the breadth of behavior that may make women caution one another about a man. ""I'm not saying everyone who gropes someone at a party is a rapist,"" feminist journalist Ann Friedman told me. ""But a lack of awareness of power imbalance as it relates to age and gender and title, in terms of the private warnings that go out among women: There is a reason to flag that.""

Yet there are definite risks, even for victims, in conflating all abuses of power with the most egregious ones. ""It's really important to parse out the difference between who is kind of sleazy and who is a sexual predator, even if they both come from the same place: toxic masculinity,"" Collier Meyerson, a contributor to the Nation, told me. ""It can ruin lives."" For one thing, men of color are still likelier to be perceived as predatory (one study of exonerations found that black men are 3 1 / times more likely to be wrongly incarcerated for sexual assault than white men). For another, as we become attuned to the subtler gradients of violation, how do we respect people's accounts of harm while figuring out how to prioritize the most harmful?

This time around, the conversation about violations feels different, more urgent and revelatory, as if we seem to relearn about boundaries every couple of months, when people stop keeping a powerful man's secrets. It's a lesson I'm always learning myself. Even after years of reporting on and studying these issues, I find myself revisiting, with a shudder, intrusions I've shrugged off for the sake of getting on with my life and my job: the flirtatious boss early in my career who made me doubt that my work was worth anything, but also the bad boyfriends whom I forgave, even when it was over something like using a condom. My silence, too, protected them.

None of this means women shouldn't be treated like adults who can make our own decisions — or that we cannot harm ourselves. Conservatives who think chivalry is a sufficient answer to these problems fail to see the difference between requests for protection and demands for respect. But it does make for a complicated world. Penney describes men she knew feeling ""bewildered. Uncomfortable. Wrestling with the specter of their own wrongdoing. Frightened, most of all, about how the ground rules for being a worthwhile person are changing so fast."" They have indeed changed quickly, if also too slowly. But men who are worried might want to think through what it means that they wield more power than they understand. The absence of a no, or even the issuance of a yes, is not always so simple. Men who want to be with women should learn a grown-up lesson most women learned long ago: Just because you want something doesn't mean you're entitled to get it.

As a teenager I started obsessing over the possibility of a nose job so that I would look more like Danica McKellar, with a chin job to balance things out. Soon I wondered if I should get breast implants to look more like Christina Applegate, who got so much attention for her curves. I consistently felt like a troll compared to many of my contemporaries. A “TV Guide” critic described me, in a review of the pilot episode of “Blossom,” as having a “shield-shaped” face of “mismatched features.” I never recovered from seeing myself that way."

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/briefing/malta-catalonia-austria.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&UwtP,"Iraq, Catalonia, #MeToo: Your Tuesday Briefing",['Patrick Boehler'],2017-10-17T04:03:07.000Z,"130 million years ago, while dinosaurs still walked the Earth, a pair of dead stars collided. The explosion rattled spacetime and sent waves of light across the universe. On August 17, 2017, light from that explosion appeared as a bright pinprick in the galaxy NGC 4993, then faded to a glowing red ember. Ripples of traumatized spacetime from the distant explosion squeezed and stretched the L-shaped arms of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Converted to sound waves, the ripples produced a faint rising chirp. Two seconds later, NASA’s Fermi space telescope detected a gamma ray burst. A brief glint of high-energy radiation from one of the most violent events in nature. Astronomers raced to point their telescopes before the precious light faded away. First on the scene was the Swope telescope in Chile. Right on its heels was the nearby Dark Energy Camera. The antennas of the Very Large Array strained to record radio emissions from the fireball. Even the Hubble space telescope turned its peerless mirror toward NGC 4993. Within hours, the distant explosion had become one of the most observed events in recent astronomical history. Astronomers think the story began with a pair of massive stars that were orbiting each other. The larger star ran out of fuel and collapsed into a dense neutron star. Neutron stars are the densest visible objects in the universe, spinning dervishes bristling with powerful magnetic fields. A teaspoonful of this starstuff would weigh as much as Mount Everest. The intense gravity of the neutron star began to steal gas from its aging sister star. The swirl of hot gas dragged the two stars together until the neutron star began orbiting inside its sister, shredding its outer layers into a swirling cloud of elements. But the sister star survived this mutilation, and eventually exploded, too. Collapsing into a second neutron star. The fuse was now lit for one final cataclysm. Twin spheres of incredible density were now locked in an ever tightening dance of doom. Shedding energy in the form of gravitational waves, the two neutron stars spiralled closer and closer, faster and faster. And finally merged in a moment of astrophysical ecstasy. A kilonova explosion. A crucible for cosmic alchemy. The swirling cloud of superheated atoms was bombarded with neutrons, forging new atoms of gold and platinum and other heavy elements. Scientists think most of the precious metals in the universe were created in kilonova explosions like these. When black holes collide there is nothing to see, though LIGO can hear the chirp from their gravitational waves. But neutron stars are visible matter, and collide within a glowing cloud. This was the first gravitational-wave catastrophe that astronomers saw as well as heard. Our first glimpse of the mysterious physics inside neutron stars. And a first fleeting glimpse of a cosmic mint in the sky."

https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/16/16481698/metoo-hashtag-responds-to-mayim-bialik-victim-blaming,#MeToo: survivors testify to the impossibility of preempting sexual assault,['Aja Romano'],2017-10-16T12:30:02-04:00,"Widespread outrage over the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations continued to play out on social media over the weekend — this time through #MeToo, a powerful hashtag aimed at illustrating that anyone can be a victim of sexual harassment.

The hashtag was spurred primarily by an opinion piece in the New York Times, “Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein's World,” which was written by The Big Bang Theory’s Mayim Bialik and quickly went viral. Bialik argued that women are essentially harassed on a hierarchical tier based on how attractive they are and how they dress.

The argument was an affront to many readers, who rushed to point out that in reality, women of all types are harassed. As discussion of Bialik’s op-ed continued, actress Alyssa Milano suggested that women reply “me too” to a single tweet:

This isn’t the first time the idea of testifying to sexual assault through the framing of a “me too” has gained traction. An earlier ""Me Too"" movement was started over a decade ago by black feminist Tarana Burke, to empower other black women and girls who are sexual assault survivors.

Milano wasn’t aware of that background until Vox reached her for comment Monday evening, whereupon she tweeted noting the movement’s origin story, which she described as “heartbreaking and inspiring.”

But the idea resonated with many women and other survivors, who responded to Milano’s original tweet and passed it on.

The idea spread rapidly, as women began speaking about their experiences with sexual harassment and assault on both Twitter and Facebook, and the #MeToo hashtag was born.

In her op-ed, Bialik painted herself as being savvy enough to preemptively ward off sexual assault

Bialik’s op-ed piece in the Times was framed as an account of her personal experience with rigorous beauty standards in Hollywood relative to the Weinstein scandal. Her argument was two-pronged: She suggested that Hollywood’s emphasis on extreme beauty has insulated her from the worst forms of harassment throughout her career, and she described the acts of “self-protection” — including dressing down and modifying her behavior — that have helped her ward off unwanted attention from men.

“As a proud feminist with little desire to diet, get plastic surgery or hire a personal trainer, I have almost no personal experience with men asking me to meetings in their hotel rooms,” she wrote. “Those of us in Hollywood who don’t represent an impossible standard of beauty have the ‘luxury’ of being overlooked and, in many cases, ignored by men in power unless we can make them money.”

While Bialik acknowledged that “Nothing — absolutely nothing — excuses men for assaulting or abusing women,” she went on to declare that women “can’t be naïve about the culture we live in,” explaining that she makes “choices” she deems “self-protecting and wise.”

“I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with,” she wrote. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.”

Many people who read the piece felt that it amounted to victim blaming, and that Bialik was unforgivably asking potential targets of sexual assault to be responsible for curbing the behavior of predatory men. But the more widespread backlash was reserved for Bialik’s suggestion that only pretty women experience harassment and assault.

In particular, numerous actresses spoke out, with many saying that their own experiences with sexual assault didn’t align with what Bialik was arguing.

Bialik’s own experience also didn’t align with those of the thousands of survivors who trended the #MeToo hashtag in response.

Words of support and empowerment were also widespread.

There were also calls for men to do more to combat harassment, instead of relying on women to do so by sharing their stories:

Twitter’s ongoing role in the discussion wasn’t forgotten either:

Bialik responded to the backlash Sunday night, tweeting that her words had been taken out of context.

There was, however, at least one chilling reminder that the “too ugly to be raped” myth is alive and well:

Update: This story has been updated to include the historical context of the “me too” movement started by Tarana Burke over a decade ago."

http://dlvr.it/Pw2rjL,"Iraq, Catalonia, #MeToo: Your Tuesday Briefing",['Patrick Boehler'],2017-10-17T04:03:07.000Z,"130 million years ago, while dinosaurs still walked the Earth, a pair of dead stars collided. The explosion rattled spacetime and sent waves of light across the universe. On August 17, 2017, light from that explosion appeared as a bright pinprick in the galaxy NGC 4993, then faded to a glowing red ember. Ripples of traumatized spacetime from the distant explosion squeezed and stretched the L-shaped arms of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Converted to sound waves, the ripples produced a faint rising chirp. Two seconds later, NASA’s Fermi space telescope detected a gamma ray burst. A brief glint of high-energy radiation from one of the most violent events in nature. Astronomers raced to point their telescopes before the precious light faded away. First on the scene was the Swope telescope in Chile. Right on its heels was the nearby Dark Energy Camera. The antennas of the Very Large Array strained to record radio emissions from the fireball. Even the Hubble space telescope turned its peerless mirror toward NGC 4993. Within hours, the distant explosion had become one of the most observed events in recent astronomical history. Astronomers think the story began with a pair of massive stars that were orbiting each other. The larger star ran out of fuel and collapsed into a dense neutron star. Neutron stars are the densest visible objects in the universe, spinning dervishes bristling with powerful magnetic fields. A teaspoonful of this starstuff would weigh as much as Mount Everest. The intense gravity of the neutron star began to steal gas from its aging sister star. The swirl of hot gas dragged the two stars together until the neutron star began orbiting inside its sister, shredding its outer layers into a swirling cloud of elements. But the sister star survived this mutilation, and eventually exploded, too. Collapsing into a second neutron star. The fuse was now lit for one final cataclysm. Twin spheres of incredible density were now locked in an ever tightening dance of doom. Shedding energy in the form of gravitational waves, the two neutron stars spiralled closer and closer, faster and faster. And finally merged in a moment of astrophysical ecstasy. A kilonova explosion. A crucible for cosmic alchemy. The swirling cloud of superheated atoms was bombarded with neutrons, forging new atoms of gold and platinum and other heavy elements. Scientists think most of the precious metals in the universe were created in kilonova explosions like these. When black holes collide there is nothing to see, though LIGO can hear the chirp from their gravitational waves. But neutron stars are visible matter, and collide within a glowing cloud. This was the first gravitational-wave catastrophe that astronomers saw as well as heard. Our first glimpse of the mysterious physics inside neutron stars. And a first fleeting glimpse of a cosmic mint in the sky."

http://ift.tt/2ii7bq5,"Iraq, Catalonia, #MeToo: Your Tuesday Briefing",['Patrick Boehler'],2017-10-17T04:03:07.000Z,"130 million years ago, while dinosaurs still walked the Earth, a pair of dead stars collided. The explosion rattled spacetime and sent waves of light across the universe. On August 17, 2017, light from that explosion appeared as a bright pinprick in the galaxy NGC 4993, then faded to a glowing red ember. Ripples of traumatized spacetime from the distant explosion squeezed and stretched the L-shaped arms of the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Converted to sound waves, the ripples produced a faint rising chirp. Two seconds later, NASA’s Fermi space telescope detected a gamma ray burst. A brief glint of high-energy radiation from one of the most violent events in nature. Astronomers raced to point their telescopes before the precious light faded away. First on the scene was the Swope telescope in Chile. Right on its heels was the nearby Dark Energy Camera. The antennas of the Very Large Array strained to record radio emissions from the fireball. Even the Hubble space telescope turned its peerless mirror toward NGC 4993. Within hours, the distant explosion had become one of the most observed events in recent astronomical history. Astronomers think the story began with a pair of massive stars that were orbiting each other. The larger star ran out of fuel and collapsed into a dense neutron star. Neutron stars are the densest visible objects in the universe, spinning dervishes bristling with powerful magnetic fields. A teaspoonful of this starstuff would weigh as much as Mount Everest. The intense gravity of the neutron star began to steal gas from its aging sister star. The swirl of hot gas dragged the two stars together until the neutron star began orbiting inside its sister, shredding its outer layers into a swirling cloud of elements. But the sister star survived this mutilation, and eventually exploded, too. Collapsing into a second neutron star. The fuse was now lit for one final cataclysm. Twin spheres of incredible density were now locked in an ever tightening dance of doom. Shedding energy in the form of gravitational waves, the two neutron stars spiralled closer and closer, faster and faster. And finally merged in a moment of astrophysical ecstasy. A kilonova explosion. A crucible for cosmic alchemy. The swirling cloud of superheated atoms was bombarded with neutrons, forging new atoms of gold and platinum and other heavy elements. Scientists think most of the precious metals in the universe were created in kilonova explosions like these. When black holes collide there is nothing to see, though LIGO can hear the chirp from their gravitational waves. But neutron stars are visible matter, and collide within a glowing cloud. This was the first gravitational-wave catastrophe that astronomers saw as well as heard. Our first glimpse of the mysterious physics inside neutron stars. And a first fleeting glimpse of a cosmic mint in the sky."

There is so much we don’t know, but there is research that tells us some specifics about the state of the problem and the factors that make it better or worse in different workplaces.

Harvey Weinstein’s long alleged history of sexually preying on actresses, journalists, and musicians — and then scaring them into silence — has spurred a deeply charged national conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace. As more women speak up about this issue, demanding something be done, there is a lack of clarity of what can be.

The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a government agency responsible for processing the sexual harassment complaints that do get reported, says nearly one-third of the 90,000 complaints received in 2015 included a harassment allegation — but the agency notes that that number is far too low to reflect reality. They also estimate that 75 percent of all workplace harassment incidents go unreported altogether.

In 2016, the EEOC released a comprehensive study of workplace harassment in the United States, which concluded that “anywhere from 25% to 85% of women report having experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.” It’s a strikingly wide gap, but one that is very substantial even in its most conservative estimate — statistically predicting one in four people are affected by workplace sexual harassment.

In this void of concrete empirical data, we pieced together reports, surveys, and studies to outline the state of workplace sexual harassment in the United States — and what can be done to address it.

Sexual harassment is not an industry-specific problem, but some environments are worse, according to Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center:
• In male-dominated industries like construction, where women are seen as interlopers, women experience high levels of harassment.
• Service-based industries, in which employers rely on tips and customer approval, can also breed an environment of harassment. Reports have also indicated customer behavior can impact how supervisors treat their employees.
• Women in low-wage jobs, like hotel cleaners or farm workers, experience high levels of harassment because they do not have bargaining power to push back.

“Part of what sexual harassment is is an expression of power and expression of hostility,” Martin said. “When there aren’t women there to do the job, some men think women can’t do the job. When there are fewer women in the workplace, they are more isolated in general.”

Unionized workforces often see women being paid more equally and earning higher wages, which could help foster a more open culture around harassment reporting — unionized workforces in general aim to offer workers protections that could make victims less fearful of coming forward. But that doesn’t make them void of this kind of issue.

While workplace sexual harassment is often discussed in terms of women, men also experience sexual harassment in the workplace. According to a Washington Post survey, 10 percent of men have experienced sexual harassment at work. According to the EEOC, reports of men experiencing workplace sexual assault have nearly doubled between 1990 and 2009, from 8 percent to 16 percent of all claims.

This could be a sign of more incidents among men, but also is largely indicative of a changing culture around reporting, in which more people feel comfortable coming forward.

2) 75 percent of harassment victims experienced retaliation when they spoke up

As the Weinstein case exemplifies, women often don’t come forward with their experiences out of fear of retaliation. These fears are very valid and well-founded.

“One 2003 study found that 75% of employees who spoke out against workplace mistreatment faced some form of retaliation,” the EEOC report found.

In Weinstein’s case, the Hollywood executive would threaten up-and-coming actresses’ careers if they did not engage with him, or place negative stories about them in the media to mire their names in scandal. These tactics aim to isolate and silence victims.

When people do come forward, Vox’s Anna North explained, it’s usually when others around them do — strength in numbers. Once some of Weinstein’s accusers came out, more followed.

Formal reporting is the “least common response” among men and woman who have experienced harassment in the workplace — “approximately 30% of individuals who experienced harassment talked with a supervisor, manager, or union representative,” the EEOC study said. It continued:

A lot of this underreporting comes down to a fear of retaliation from the employers or colleagues. Victims often fear they won’t be believed, or will receive blame or be subject to professional retaliation — like being fired from their jobs.

3) When acts of “harassment” are specifically defined, more women report incidents

But there are also other factors that lead to underreporting.

Digging deeper into the numbers of people affected by workplace sexual harassment, the EEOC found that reports of incidents grew when the specific acts that count as harassment were more specifically defined in surveys.

In other words, when people were just asked outright if they had experienced sexual harassment at work, without the term being defined, one in four reported having experienced some form of harassment in the workplace.

But when specific acts of harassment were mentioned, like sexual coercion or crude jokes, 60 percent of women reported having experienced some form of sexual or gender harassment.

This indicates a lack of societal clarity around what constitutes harassment in the workplace — and what is brushed off as just uncomfortable encounters. The EEOC recommended sexual harassment trainings as an effective way to clarify those gray areas.

4) Those once-a-year sexual harassment seminars likely do nothing

Company sexual harassment training is easily mocked — and often brushed off in popular culture.

Even the EEOC admits its ineffectiveness:

“Much of the training done over the last 30 years has not worked as a prevention tool — it’s been too focused on simply avoiding legal liability,” its report says.

But there are innovations to anti-harassment programs that have seen some results, Martin says — namely in bystander training and tailoring programs to specific workplaces.

There is also an emphasis on middle managers, who are seen as the first line of defense against inappropriate behavior. One witness told the EEOC’s researchers:

None of this works, however, if there isn’t a clear message from the top that the company is invested in its employees and their well-being.

From the Weinstein events, as we saw with Fox News’s Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly, there is often institutional pressure to push allegations under the rug — the idea being that companies with a public face don’t want sexual harassment claims to go public because the alleged harasser is often a company star.

It’s why companies often process claims through mandatory confidential arbitration instead of an open court, and why so many cases allow for nondisclosure agreements.

These tactics can be effective in hiding the problem on two fronts: They keep victims feeling isolated, and at times like the only people affected, and they insulate the perpetrator. But the incentives might be backward.

“A superstar employee that is creating that toxic work environment is probably costing that company more than he or she is bringing in,” Martin says.

According to the EEOC, in 1994 the Merit Systems Protection Board, a federal agency that oversee the abuses targeting federal employees, conservatively estimated that “as a result of sexual harassment, job turnover ($24.7 million), sick leave ($14.9 million), and decreased individual ($93.7 million) and workgroup ($193.8) productivity had cost the government a total of $327.1 million.”

It all goes to say that there are a lot of systems in place that prevent people from speaking up.

“Even if you are rich famous and powerful, you can feel isolated in these situations,” Martin said. “But if you are not rich and famous and powerful, you still have to get your paycheck because it’s between you and homelessness. There are good reasons why it’s hard for women to bring formal complaints in these situations.”"

Varian'],2006-04-06T05:00:00.000Z,"Interestingly, employers thought beautiful people were more productive even when their only interaction was by telephone. It appears that the confidence that beautiful people have in themselves comes across over the phone as well as in person. But even when the experimenters controlled for self-confidence, they found that employers overestimated the productivity of beautiful people. The economists estimated that about 15 percent to 20 percent of the beauty premium is a result of the self-confidence effect, while oral and visual communication each contribute about 40 percent."
http://wapo.st/2xJzcsA?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.a962b9ebac3e,Opinion | #MeToo is spreading. Are men getting let off the hook?,[],2017-10-16T18:40:19Z,"The raw numbers certainly succeeded in conveying the scope of the problem, Milano’s goal. Yet as I scrolled through the posts on social media, all I could feel was weariness. After all, this is far from the first effort to use social media to raise awareness about sexual harassment and assault, and not the first that asks women to share their pain while men get to be passive observers. There was #YesAllWomen in 2014, which discussed misogyny and violence against women after Elliot Rodger killed six people in Isla Vista, Calif., an attack seemingly inspired by his hatred for women. There was #NotOkay a year ago, after The Post reported on an “Access Hollywood” video in which then-candidate Donald Trump bragged about assaulting women. That was followed up by #WhyWomenDontReport, once Trump’s surrogates attempted to discredit the women who said Trump had assaulted them.

And it’s not just social media: In 2011, women started organizing SlutWalk marches to protest victim-blaming attitudes around sexual assault, with many marchers carrying heartbreaking signs detailing their experiences of assault and harassment. As sexual assault survivors have organized on college campuses, many have come forward to speak to the media about their experiences in detail. Take Back the Night first started in the 1970s and continues on college campuses and in cities across the world. Women are asked to show their scars, to speak about their traumas, to make experiences public. Which raises the question: When can we move past describing the violence against women and move toward demanding that the perpetrators — and the people who enable them — change their behavior?

This is not meant as a critique of the women who are speaking out. I know that talking about assault and harassment can be an empowering step. (Yes, me too, of course.) But this collective display of trauma can too easily allow others, men especially, to offer sympathetic comments and social-media “likes” without being forced to reflect on their own actions. Do they need to change the way they treat women? Do they look the other way or make excuses when they find out that someone they know has assaulted someone else? What other signals are they sending that say sexual violence will go unpunished? (Trump did get elected president after the “Access Hollywood” video and assault allegations came out, after all.)

There are already a few models of constructive ways forward. Bystander-intervention programs have some proven success in getting people to intervene more often. And going back to hashtags, activist Feminista Jones began the hashtag #YouOkSis in 2014 not only for women, particularly black women, to share stories of street harassment, but also to share tips to protect women and de-escalate harassment as a bystander.

Colin Firth recently expressed his “shame” that he hadn’t acted when a co-worker told him about a “distressing encounter” with Weinstein. But if men don’t allow that shame to push them toward action, there will continue to be more Harvey Weinsteins and Roger Aileses and Bill O’Reillys and Bill Cosbys and other alleged abusers who aren’t famous but still harass and hurt women. Here’s to hoping the next hashtag that emerges around sexual violence will be from men collectively working to decrease violence and harassment against women. #MenToo have a role to play."

As a teenager I started obsessing over the possibility of a nose job so that I would look more like Danica McKellar, with a chin job to balance things out. Soon I wondered if I should get breast implants to look more like Christina Applegate, who got so much attention for her curves. I consistently felt like a troll compared to many of my contemporaries. A “TV Guide” critic described me, in a review of the pilot episode of “Blossom,” as having a “shield-shaped” face of “mismatched features.” I never recovered from seeing myself that way."

http://nypost.com/2017/04/05/passenger-from-hell-threatens-to-accuse-uber-driver-of-rape/,Passenger from hell threatens to accuse Uber driver of rape,[],2017-04-06T03:26:51+00:00,"An enraged Bronx woman threatened to falsely accuse an Uber driver of rape and assault — after he told her he didn’t have a charger for her phone, footage shows.

“I’m going to start screaming out the window that you’re raping me, that you raped me,” the female passenger can be heard saying in a dashcam video posted by LiveLeak.

“I will punch myself in the face and tell the cops you did it,” she adds. “You wanna play?”

The incident is said to have occurred Monday in the Bronx, according to the video-sharing website.

The woman also hurled racial expletives at the driver and told him to “go back to your country.”

“Donald Trump going to send you and your family back,” she seethes. “Get the f–k out of my country.”

The heated exchange apparently stemmed from an argument over the driver not having an iPhone charger.

“If I don’t have a charger, politely ask me. I’ll politely tell you, ‘I’m sorry, I don’t have a charger,'” the man says. “But you start disrespecting me.”

The woman’s phone was supposedly dead and she thought Uber drivers were required to have chargers.

“I don’t have to have a charger,” the driver says.

Throughout the video, the passenger and the driver repeatedly tell each other to call police.

“I’m not getting out, call the cops,” the woman says.

“I will spit in your face, I’m from the Bronx,” she adds.

“Are you gonna shut up so I can take you to your destination?” the driver asks.

“I will punch myself in the face and tell the cops you did it,” the woman says. “You’re going to jail … You wanna play yourself? I’ll call the cops right now … I’m going to tell them you’re holding me against my will … You’re going to jail for domestic violence.”

In response, the driver simply says: “Yeah, whatever … Get out of my car.”

After a few more seconds of arguing, he politely asks, “What’s wrong with you?” — sparking another tirade from the woman.

“I will spit in your face,” she says again. “I will violate you, n—a.”

Moments later, the rider snaps — screaming at the top of her lungs to call her boyfriend — all while the driver looks at the camera and smiles.

“I was taking you to your destination until you started talking s–t,” he says, just before the woman realizes she’s being recorded.

“Why are you recording me,” she yells, while punching the man’s seats. “He just hit me in my face!”

After he tells the passenger that she can “make up whatever lies [she] wants,” the woman eventually gets out of the car and leaves.

The driver — who claims to have been with Uber for “over two years” — can be heard venting about the incident as soon as she’s gone.

“You see these stupid b—hes,” he says. “You see what she did. Stupid Bronx b—h. See, people?! I’m not saying all the females, some b—-hes like this. F—ing thot. This is Uptown New York, man. Bronx. We got stupid b—hes out here. Sorry for my language. This is how Uber drivers goes [sic] through every f–king day, man. People would disrespect us, talk s–t to us like it’s nothing, man.”

Several Uber drivers have been arrested in recent years for allegedly raping or assaulting female riders.

On Sunday, a driver was arrested in Southern California on suspicion of sexually assaulting a women he picked up March 30. He was taken into custody the next day, after the woman went to police and reported him.

Last month, an Uber driver was charged with abduction, rape and aggravated sexual assault in Virginia Beach, Virginia, after a female passenger filed a police report against him."
